Overall the structure is excellent, and content and explanations are very clear and of good quality and depth. I think it's well on its way towards becoming a submittable paper, but we probably need to think of another twist or insight to add, and also add a few more baseline comparisons and human evaluations, etc., to cover our bases.
- Finetuning the models may help with this.
- Another bottleneck is the being constrained to 5 candidate summaries.
- Considering a broader suite of LLMs and only considering the output space may also help with this (aligned with this prompting idea).
- Doing this in representation space is likely another paper.
- Connecting this with Maxime's paper?
