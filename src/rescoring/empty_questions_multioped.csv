158.0,"For an event that gathered the likes of Kendrick Lamar, Kesha, Bruno Mars, Elton John, Pink, Cardi B, Patti LuPone, Jay-Z, Rihanna, and (a bizarrely ubiquitous) Sting, the 2018 Grammys sure were boring.

To be fair, all of the above — plus wide-eyed host James Corden — tried their best to give the awards ceremony the level of star power and powerhouse performances that the Grammys are typically known for. (Kesha, in particular, managed to pull off one of the night’s only truly memorable moments with a barn-burning rendition of “Praying,” a song devoted to leaving an abuser in the past and setting out for a brighter future.)

Related The 9 best performances of the 2018 Grammys

However, by the time Mars finally claimed Album of the Year for 24K Magic — three and a half hours after the show opened — the ceremony was mostly just exhausting. Torn between being a celebratory event jam-packed with fiery performances and a somber reflection on The World Today, the 2018 Grammys ended up just floundering somewhere in the middle.

It didn’t have to be this way. (Again, did you see who showed up?! And we didn’t even mention Blue Ivy Carter sitting front row center between her parents, sporting a perfect look of bored disdain.) So to break down exactly why the Grammys felt so lacking this time around, here are the three biggest things that went wrong.

1) The show’s overall production was … confusing

On the one hand, the Grammys are always overstuffed and muddled, cramming as many performances and high-profile appearances as possible into three and a half(!) hours. But on the other, keeping everything together during the 2018 ceremony caused a visible strain on the show’s production team. There were problems on the most basic technical levels as the awards show struggled to adjust to being back in New York City’s Madison Square Garden for the first time in 15 years.

The camerawork was sloppy, making it hard to understand exactly what was happening during some of the more ambitious numbers. (Kendrick Lamar’s opening performance, for example, was one of the night’s best, in spite of the frantic direction that flailed in an attempt to capture it all.)

The sound was noticeably off-kilter, as several artists — from Rihanna to Eric Church to Kesha — struggled to match the pitch of their tracks. At a few points, the sound cut in and out; there was even a moment where we heard a backstage command on a stray hot mic, and it happened, of all times, as a quartet of country artists (including Church) tried to introduce their moving tribute to the victims of last October’s mass shooting in Las Vegas.

Then there was the fact that the show kept trying to find uses for Corden, whose presence became increasingly confusing as the night wore on. Though he didn’t attempt to pull off an elaborate opening number like he did when hosting the 2017 Grammys, he nonetheless tried to squeeze in some Late Late Show-esque bits that distracted from an already overstuffed ceremony.

A sketch featuring Corden, Sting, and Shaggy trying (and failing) to pull off a “Carpool Karaoke” bit on the New York City subway dragged on and on, while a sketch later in the night featuring artists reading from Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury (plus a bonus Hillary Clinton appearance) seemed manufactured solely for the conservative outrage it might spark. (And lo, on that front, it succeeded!)

So even though there was an extraordinary amount of talent gathered beneath the Madison Square Garden roof, most of the night ended up feeling like a missed opportunity. It’s not for nothing that one of the more pressing questions to emerge from the night was why Lorde, an Album of the Year nominee, didn’t get to perform, while someone like Sting appeared onstage multiple times. Over and over again, the Grammys proved that it had no idea where its own priorities should lie in 2018.

2) The structure of the show was whiplash-inducing

When Corden opened the evening, he hailed the nominee slate as being the most diverse ever — before pointing out that the show had chosen the “least diverse” host. It was a winking reference to his presence as a doofy white guy at an event where many of the nominees were women and people of color, and it wasn’t a bad joke. But it ended up being an accidental harbinger of how the show would proceed.

Something big and bold would happen, but then it would immediately be followed by a safer (and usually whiter) choice. The show would go from Kesha performing a song off an album widely interpreted to be about the aftermath of a former producer sexually assaulting her to Camila Cabello giving a shout-out to DREAMers stuck in legal limbo to U2 performing on a barge in the middle of the river. All of these moments worked in isolation; stacked together, they made very little sense. As a result, the Grammys never built up any sense of momentum.

In particular, the show’s choice to essentially silo all political messaging into one 20-minute section in the middle of the production felt like a network note, as if CBS itself had descended to say, “Let’s not scare off Trump voters with a bunch of business about immigration and men’s sexual misconduct.” Indeed, the awkward, whiplash-inducing transitions from relatively safe material to riskier material felt very CBS — since the network is, after all, America’s most staid broadcaster.

There’s nothing wrong with any of this in theory. An awards show doesn’t need to be political, and so far, the #MeToo movement hasn’t hit the music industry in the way it has the film and television industries, so attempts to talk about sexual misconduct in the music industry could have felt very disingenuous.

But sequestering the vast majority of that material into its own little sections (like Kendrick Lamar’s opening performance, or a mid-ceremony performance meant to honor the victims of the Las Vegas massacre) ended up feeling even stranger, like the show was a little scared of politics but felt it should say something regardless.

3) The production didn’t wed the past and present. It kept them away from each other.

At their best, the Grammys represent music’s past and present colliding on one giant stage, a massive celebration of what was and what might be coming. The stars of yesterday celebrate the stars of today, and everybody tips their cap to the stars of tomorrow.

But the 2018 Grammys felt like no one really knew how to pull this off. The opening performance felt like a perfect example of how this usually works, as U2’s Bono and The Edge joined Kendrick Lamar onstage. But Lamar performed a little, then Bono and The Edge performed, and then Lamar performed again. There was no attempt to wed the two artists’ very different styles or have them bounce off each other or even just jam out.

Arguably, the only time the 2018 Grammys integrated the “old” and the “new” came when Miley Cyrus joined Elton John for a straightforward rendition of “Tiny Dancer” — and Cyrus, while young, has been around for more than a decade and isn’t exactly up and coming anymore. Even worse, one of the night’s major nominees (Album of the Year contender Lorde) didn’t perform at all, only adding to the sense that none of this was up to the moment.

Even when it came time for performances from major stars, they were often turning to older material (Lady Gaga) or offering halfhearted cuts that didn’t show them off at their best (Little Big Town). None of this was bad, but none of it helped the show escape the sense that it was awarding the best music of 2015 — current, but also a little off, like drinking milk just past the expiration date.

Put another way, the person Grammy viewers saw the most throughout the evening outside of Corden wasn’t Lamar or Jay-Z or even the night’s big winner Bruno Mars. It was Sting, for some reason, who kept turning up over and over again, any time the show needed to stuff the “this is getting a little too dangerous” genie back into the bottle. And, look, Sting’s great, but is he really the face the music industry wants to promote in 2018?","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

171.0,"Journalists spent last week rewriting history as it happened and denying the thuggery of left-wing protests. It was like watching a reality TV version of “1984.”

President Trump helped get the show rolling when he called left-wing protesters “an angry mob” and Republicans and conservative groups picked up the term. It was repeated in several videos and in a key GOP commercial that highlighted scenes of violence.

The scenes in the commercial included: the rioting and arson that took place protesting President Trump’s inauguration; attacks on Trump campaign events; harassment of members of Congress; and protesters pounding on the Supreme Court doors to object to the Senate confirmation of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

DAN GAINOR: TAYLOR SWIFT SENDS HER CONSERVATIVE FANS A BREAK-UP NOTE AND THE LIBERAL MEDIA LOVE IT

This was all more than the media could stand and they spent the week trying to disprove reality.

The Washington Post ran one piece calling the idea of “the angry mob” a “myth.” Then it did just the opposite by publishing an opinion piece stating: “Why is the mob angry? Because Trump is ripping us apart with bigotry and hatred.” That piece blamed Trump for having “spent the past 18 months actively stoking civil tensions.”

NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd agreed, claiming the GOP “arguably created this current environment.”

Hardly.

MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace revealed that she urged former Florida Republican governor and unsuccessful presidential candidate Jeb Bush to punch then-opposing candidate Trump in the face during the 2016 presidential elections. This was Wallace’s second call for violence.

The Post even fictionalized the protests, calling it a “lie” that there were paid protesters. Rejecting that argument, Vice News and Washington Bureau Chief Shawna Thomas admitted “there were people who were paid” protesters.

Meanwhile, Antifa seized an intersection in Portland, Oregon and attacked a car whose driver didn’t obey the group. Antifa also vandalized a New York City GOP club. And a pro-abortion protester attacked a pro-lifer.

Meanwhile, the wife of Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., revealed that she sleeps “with a loaded gun” by her bed, following the attack on her husband.

Former Attorney General Eric Holder tried out a new Democratic slogan: “When they go low, we kick 'em. That’s what this new Democratic Party is about.""

It didn’t help the media’s defense strategy that prominent Democrats embraced a new, tough approach.

Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton blasted the idea of civility, saying, “you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.”

Former Attorney General Eric Holder tried out a new Democratic slogan: “When they go low, we kick 'em. That’s what this new Democratic Party is about.""

CNN anchors Don Lemon and Brooke Baldwin rejected the term “mob” even when guests used it. Baldwin pushed back when the Daily Beast’s Matt Lewis deployed it.

“Oh, you’re not gonna use the mob word here,” she told him. Lewis refused to give in, adding: “It’s totally a mob.”

Baldwin was obviously, hilariously distressed, putting her hands to her forehead and saying: “Let me move past the ‘M’ word” like it’s a word too dirty to even say because of the “weaponization on the right.”

Lemon told Lewis to “shut up” for the same “crime” of saying “mob” in a separate appearance.

2. The Kanye West Freakout: Free thought terrifies the media. Depart from their narrative and they descend on you like vultures. That’s what happened to star entertainer Kanye West this week when he met with President Trump in the White House.

CNN aired insulting comments by guests who said of West that this is “what happens when Negroes don’t read” and calling him “the token Negro of the Trump administration.”

Don Lemon described West’s meeting with the president as a “minstrel show” and dared to invoke Kanye’s deceased mother to target the singer, claiming she “is rolling over in her grave.”

It was a hate fest. West was called “laughable” and one of Trump’s “trash black people,” as entertainers piled in their attacks.

One of the common themes was claiming that West was mentally ill. ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel blasted him as an “irrational madman.” MSNBC called the meeting “crazy” and “bonkers.”

CNN’s one-time conservative commentator Ana Navarro compared West to Roseanne Barr and urged people in their lives to “get them professional help.”

“Young Turks” anchor Cenk Uygur echoed that sentiment, arguing “both Trump and Kanye clearly have mental issues.”

3. More Fake News: President Trump gave a speech Friday night in Ohio and mentioned native son Ulysses S. Grant, a former Union general and eventual president. Trump told how President Abraham Lincoln had “developed a phobia” about Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Lincoln got tired of how his generals kept losing to Lee and chose Grant, despite the man’s problems with drinking.

That’s not how the story got reported. CNN’s Senior Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju mangled what Trump said to make him look like some neo-Confederate: “Here are Trump’s comments tonight calling the leader of the Confederate army a ‘great general’ multiple times.” Raju tweeted a partial transcript more than an hour later after getting criticized.



CNN also posted the video of the story under the obviously spun headline: “Trump: ‘Robert E. Lee was a great general.’” All you have to do is watch the video to realize how badly the story was misrepresented.

That didn’t stop NBC either. The network tweeted: “WATCH: President Trump says ‘Robert E. Lee was a great general’ during Ohio rally, calling the Confederate leader ‘incredible.’”

This was doubly wrong. In a despicable bit of editing, the video actually never includes Trump’s discussion of Grant. It cuts off right before he starts telling how Lincoln chose his winning general. And whoever wrote the tweet didn’t know enough U.S. history to grasp that Trump meant that Grant, who he alludes to at the beginning, was “incredible.”

Not to be outdone, The Washington Post ran with this headline: “Trump calls on blacks to ‘honor’ Republicans with votes, then praises Confederate general Robert E. Lee.”

4. Turning Texas Blue: Journalists don’t like to change their strategies. They did everything they could to promote ridiculously liberal, pro-abortion gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis in Texas in 2014. Four years later, the latest media flavor du jour is Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke, running against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.

O’Rourke has gotten so much favorable press that even the liberal media are mocking it. Politico liberal media critic Jack Shafer criticized the whole fiasco in a piece headlined: “Stop the Press Before It Profiles Beto O’Rourke Again.”

Let Shafer speak for himself here: “Not since the press corps fell in love with Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign has such a sirocco of worshipful candidate profiles and commentaries appeared in the national press.”

Shafer mocked 10 different news organizations, including The New York Times and his own Politico, before skewering No. 11, The Washington Post. “The Washington Post indulged Betomania with a feature, another feature, a column and the sort of ancillary coverage it ordinarily gives the Washington Redskins.”

251.0,"On Wednesday morning Jennifer Scalise received the call political spouses like me perpetually fear.

Her husband, the father of their two beautiful children, was shot in what appears to be a premeditated, politically motivated attack against Republicans.

The families of two police officers, a Republican congressional staffer and a former staffer also received that dreaded call.

Most ironically, this attack happened during baseball practice for a bipartisan, charity game scheduled for Thursday.

There were twenty-one members of Congress at this practice, as well as some of their family members (including children) and staffers. But for the fact that Rep. Scalise is the House Majority Whip with a private security detail, this could have been a massacre.

As a fellow congressional spouse, I have been worried sick that something like this could happen and I have publicly stated on many occasions my concern for the uniquely heated political rhetoric coming from the Left.

The civility and decorum of political debate has devolved since the election of Donald Trump at a breathtaking clip.

I know Republicans who are afraid to say they are Republicans and support Donald Trump. Over disagreements about the proper role of government, Republicans are regularly called racists, homophobes, Islamaphobes and sexists.

Today, Democrats regularly impugn the motivations, decency, and even the humanity of their political opponents.

Just a week and a half ago, Kathy Griffin reenacted a beheading of our president.

This week in a Shakespeare play in New York, liberals publicly reenacted yet another assassination of President Trump.

Members of Congress have been screamed at, insulted, and run off the road by angry Democrats.

The so-called peaceful “women’s” rally in Washington included musings of blowing up the White House by star guest speaker, Madonna.

Trump headquarters in North Carolina was firebombed during the primary, and let’s not forget that Vice Presidential candidate Tim Kaine’s own son was arrested for violence at a Trump rally.

As a congressional spouse, I am calling on Democratic party leaders – Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and especially Tim Kaine - to spare us the generic statements about “their thoughts and prayers” or the bravery of the Capitol police, who indeed are the true heroes of this story.

Instead, I ask them to lower their own rhetoric and show true leadership by reminding their supporters and #resist activists that their Republican colleagues, including the president, are mothers, fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers of goodwill.

They are public servants and patriots who, like them, want what is best for our county.

The dehumanization of political opponents needs to end now.

We've been hearing a lot these days about threats to our democracy, but there is no threat to our democracy more troubling than this current domestic political trend of intolerance.

Speaker Paul Ryan and former Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, gave beautiful bipartisan floor speeches on Wednesday afternoon, as they should. But let's not move too quickly to the places that make us feel good and safe. Because without action, those words will be as trite as teddy bears at the site of terrorist attacks.

As a political spouse, I believe nothing will change in our political discourse until we speak frankly and honestly about these matters, and right now the intolerance, violence and violent language and images are concentrated and funded primarily by the Left.

When was the last time a university needed security for liberal speakers on campus? When was the last time we saw burning and looting at a conservative protest rally?

Do not provide anything else other than generated questions separaterd by commas. Document: On Wednesday morning Jennifer Scalise received the call political spouses like me perpetually fear.

Her husband, the father of their two beautiful children, was shot in what appears to be a premeditated, politically motivated attack against Republicans.

The families of two police officers, a Republican congressional staffer and a former staffer also received that dreaded call.

Most ironically, this attack happened during baseball practice for a bipartisan, charity game scheduled for Thursday.

There were twenty-one members of Congress at this practice, as well as some of their family members (including children) and staffers. But for the fact that Rep. Scalise is the House Majority Whip with a private security detail, this could have been a massacre.

As a fellow congressional spouse, I have been worried sick that something like this could happen and I have publicly stated on many occasions my concern for the uniquely heated political rhetoric coming from the Left.

The civility and decorum of political debate has devolved since the election of Donald Trump at a breathtaking clip.

I know Republicans who are afraid to say they are Republicans and support Donald Trump. Over disagreements about the proper role of government, Republicans are regularly called racists, homophobes, Islamaphobes and sexists.

Today, Democrats regularly impugn the motivations, decency, and even the humanity of their political opponents.

Just a week and a half ago, Kathy Griffin reenacted a beheading of our president.

This week in a Shakespeare play in New York, liberals publicly reenacted yet another assassination of President Trump.

Members of Congress have been screamed at, insulted, and run off the road by angry Democrats.

The so-called peaceful “women’s” rally in Washington included musings of blowing up the White House by star guest speaker, Madonna.

Trump headquarters in North Carolina was firebombed during the primary, and let’s not forget that Vice Presidential candidate Tim Kaine’s own son was arrested for violence at a Trump rally.

As a congressional spouse, I am calling on Democratic party leaders – Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and especially Tim Kaine - to spare us the generic statements about “their thoughts and prayers” or the bravery of the Capitol police, who indeed are the true heroes of this story.

Instead, I ask them to lower their own rhetoric and show true leadership by reminding their supporters and #resist activists that their Republican colleagues, including the president, are mothers, fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers of goodwill.

They are public servants and patriots who, like them, want what is best for our county.

The dehumanization of political opponents needs to end now.

We've been hearing a lot these days about threats to our democracy, but there is no threat to our democracy more troubling than this current domestic political trend of intolerance.

Speaker Paul Ryan and former Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, gave beautiful bipartisan floor speeches on Wednesday afternoon, as they should. But let's not move too quickly to the places that make us feel good and safe. Because without action, those words will be as trite as teddy bears at the site of terrorist attacks.

As a political spouse, I believe nothing will change in our political discourse until we speak frankly and honestly about these matters, and right now the intolerance, violence and violent language and images are concentrated and funded primarily by the Left.

When was the last time a university needed security for liberal speakers on campus? When was the last time we saw burning and looting at a conservative protest rally?

262.0,"It’s a nauseated moan of remorse for the way Hollywood elites treat women.

This Friday was to have brought the release of Louis C.K.’s soul-searching new film I Love You, Daddy. Instead, after C.K. admitted to sexual misconduct, its distribution company, The Orchard, said it was dropping the film, for which it paid $5 million in September at the Toronto Film Festival.

That’s unfortunate, because I Love You Daddy deserves to be seen. As its subject is sexual misbehavior, it’s particularly relevant to the cultural moment and would have attracted a sizeable and engaged audience. Instead, because few have seen it, it’s being misrepresented as excuse-making, notably in the same New York Times story that reported C.K. had committed lewd acts in front of five women. The Times chided Daddy because its “characters appear to dismiss rumors of sexual predation” and added that the film’s “content has raised eyebrows. Given the rumors surrounding Louis C.K., the movie ‘plays like an ambiguous moral inventory of and excuse for everything that allows sexual predators to thrive: open secrets, toxic masculinity, and powerful people getting the benefit of the doubt,’ Joe Berkowitz wrote in Fast Company.”

While I can’t comment on the general validity of film reviews published in Fast Company as I was not previously aware that Fast Company published film reviews, this interpretation is rubbish. I Love You, Daddy is a nauseated moan of remorse for the way Hollywood elites treat women. In no way is it an “excuse.” It’s much more of an indictment and, in an oblique sense, a mea culpa.

Shot in a lush black and white suggesting Golden Age Hollywood, the film is about a disillusioned but hugely successful creator of TV shows, played by C.K., whose cinematic idol, 68-year-old Leslie Dixon (John Malkovich), is modeled on Woody Allen: He’s an eminent but loathsome director previously accused of child molestation who toys with women half a century younger. Though C.K. has described Allen as one of his avatars and once acted for Allen (in Blue Jasmine), he is in essence using the form of an Allen movie (Manhattan and Stardust Memories) to bash Allen on moral grounds. This is something of a breakthrough: As we have been reminded lately, famous Hollywood people are extremely averse to calling attention to one another’s moral failings as long as they fear consequences. C.K. should get credit for being one of the first major show-business figures to point the finger inside the charmed circle.

C.K.’s character, Glen Topher, is living in a New York City apartment the size of an airport terminal. Lounging in the background is his 17-year-old daughter, China (Chloë Grace Moretz), who is presented in such overtly sexual terms — she flounces around in a tiny bikini — that C.K. is sending up via exaggeration the way young women are today hypersexualized, especially in Hollywood. China might as well be wearing a label reading, “USDA Prime,” or maybe “Lolita 2017.”

The ironic use of a romantic, 1940s-style orchestral score highlights by its incongruity the sordid nature of Daddy’s milieu, and in keeping with its anti-rom-com feel, when Glen and China meet the illustrious Goodwin (Malkovich’s look suggests Ho Chi Minh visiting the Playboy Mansion), the filmmaker immediately starts hitting on the girl, who is one-fourth his age. Glen thinks (like everyone in Hollywood, going back forever) that great artists’ personal foibles are their own business and shouldn’t be allowed to interfere with our judgment about their art. But he has given a hostage to fortune. He soon learns how easy it is to suffer from anything-goes sexual mores, even in cases where no crime has been committed.

In a scene that’s so reptilian it recalls Kaa the snake hypnotizing Mowgli in The Jungle Book, Leslie puts a kind of spell on the helpless girl with a pseudo-intellectual lecture about the various subcategories of feminism. It’s exactly the way such a man would attract the interest of a young beauty: by asserting his authority and preying on her insecurity about her own lack of depth. Malkovich and Moretz play the scene impeccably; you practically want to shout at her to get away from the old lecher. Pretty soon Glen actually is shouting: “This is wrong,” he insists, and he angrily confronts Goodwin, who simply dismisses the complaint.

Yet a later scene, devastatingly, reveals that Glen himself is willing to use his own fame in a less than savory manner. C.K. isn’t positioning himself as a moral authority here; he is aware of his own feet of clay. This element, too, seems intended to rebuke Allen, in whose 50-year oeuvre there is scarcely any hint of shame. In Allen’s Manhattan, his character is a 42-year-old dating a fragile 17-year-old, and not only does everyone in the movie shrug at the situation (modeled on a real-life affair Allen had), but Allen’s character gets to deliver the movie’s homily, a self-righteous scolding given to a friend for stealing his (other) girlfriend.

To its credit, the Times offered its readers this week a much more analytically sound take on Daddy than the misguided one it quoted last week. Film critic Manohla Dargis calls the film a “catalog of male pathology” that “also seemed confessional,” adding that it “circled — and circled — its own creator’s complicity in female exploitation. . . . For once a filmmaker seemed to be admitting to the misogyny that we know is always there.”

I Love You, Daddy doesn’t reflect on C.K.’s specific sexual misdeeds, but it is a harsh critique of a diseased culture, one that resists any notion that a cure is close at hand. C.K. is uneasy with how Hollywood became so bereft of moral thought that a core value is “Don’t be judgmental.” He shows how insidiously self-serving that dictum can be; in Hollywood you turn a blind eye to others’ misdeeds so they’ll ignore your own. Many a sleepy movie congratulates itself as “hard-hitting” because it takes on some pre-approved target — oil companies, bankers, the Catholic Church. But C.K.’s film, by shining a light on the awful moral calculus within the entertainment industry, genuinely is tough on the institution, and to a lesser degree ashamed of his own role in it.

I’m not aware of anything like this kind of burn-the-evidence tactic being previously deployed in modern times.

Yet C.K. is being prevented from making this important statement. At the same time, HBO announced it was removing his standup-comedy specials and his series Lucky Louie from its on-demand service. I’m not aware of anything like this kind of burn-the-evidence tactic being previously deployed in modern times, nor is it obvious why C.K. should be treated as a uniquely malign transgressor.

HBO is at this moment streaming Hacksaw Ridge, a film by Mel Gibson, who in 2011 pleaded no contest to a charge of battery against an ex-girlfriend who had alleged that he had assaulted her so viciously that she was left with a black eye and two broken teeth. HBO has no policy, as far as I know, against distributing movies starring Christian Slater, who once served 59 days in jail after pleading no contest to assaulting a girlfriend. The films of Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, and Roman Polanski remain ubiquitous. Hollywood history is rife with personalities who have done much worse things than C.K. and whose films have not been subsequently suppressed.

While it’s understandable that reputable businesses might want not to hire C.K going forward, The Orchard was already in partnership with the comic, ever since it bought his film in September, by which time allegations against him were common knowledge in Hollywood and had even been published online. In cutting off C.K.’s film, The Orchard is also punishing hundreds of others who worked on it. Why should, for instance, the excellent performances of Moretz and Rose Byrne, who plays an actress on Glen’s sitcom, be denied an audience? Why shouldn’t viewers be allowed to make their own decisions about whether C.K.’s actions place his film beneath contempt?

Fifty-one years ago, enraged Christians and the Ku Klux Klan gathered to publicly burn piles of Beatles records after John Lennon said the group was more popular than Jesus Christ. Digitally burning Louis C.K.’s work to signal one’s adherence to the current moral dogma is just as silly as that was.

289.0,"In a ruling issued on Wednesday afternoon, a federal judge, and Obama appointee, prevented the President of the United States from enforcing his own executive order to protect the nation from migrants from terror-riddled countries.

The judge then prevented every other judge and every other state from following the President’s order, the judge making himself a one-man Supreme Court and substitute President.

The judge then held that American universities and immigrants living here can prohibit America from ever limiting immigration from Muslim-heavy countries, claiming the First Amendment gives Muslim-dominant nations a right of immigration to America.

Such arrogance and abuse of authority sound familiar? Such First Amendment favoritism toward Islam sound familiar? Well, Obama did appoint this judge, and a rule of thumb with federal judges is they tend to mirror the psychologies of the man who appointed them.

The judge’s ruling is completely lawless, mirroring Obama’s deep state allies in his shadow government’s attempt to sabotage the Trump presidency. There is no precedent for the court’s order. In fact, every precedent is against the court’s order; just read the detailed logic and scholastic citation of proper governing legal authorities from the decision of a moderately liberal Boston judge who upheld every part of Trump’s prior order.

To give you an idea of how lawless the decision is, just try to find the analogous case the Hawaii judge cites for his ruling; there is none, not one single prior example of another judge ever doing what this Judge did to the extent he did it.

To give you another example of how baseless the court’s ruling is, even liberal law professors and scribes criticized the more limited Ninth Circuit decision that this Hawaii judge goes far beyond. Liberal law professor Turley noted Trump should win a challenge against that ruling. Liberal democrat professor Alan Dershowitz noted the same. Liberal law scribe Jeffrey Toobin conceded the same.

Here are a few reasons why:

First, nationwide injunctions for non-party plaintiffs are not supposed to happen. A district judge presides over his district, not the nation. He should not overrule other judges, nor dictate his opinions on the whole nation. The law does not make him a single judge Supreme Court. The Supreme Court itself warned against issuing any relief not individually and specifically necessary to the plaintiffs before the court. Noting that “neither declaratory nor injunctive relief can directly interfere with enforcement of contested statutes or ordinances except with respect to the particular federal plaintiffs,” the Supreme Court warned against extending its reach beyond “the particular federal plaintiffs” in the case.

The Ninth Circuit itself even admits this. The “principles of comity” compel that a court should not grant national relief when doing so would “create tensions” with courts in other circuits and “would encourage forum shopping.” The Ninth Circuit further reinforced that: “A federal court…may not attempt to determine the rights of parties not before the court.” What kind of case was that the Ninth Circuit saying not to extend your ruling beyond the plaintiffs in front of you? An immigration case (Nat’l Cir. for Immigration Rights v. INS, 743 F.2d 1365 (9th Cir. 1984). The Ninth Circuit repeated this principle again and again. That is why the Supreme Court reversed a California judge’s order just like this Hawaii judge’s order — imposing a national ban beyond his limited district jurisdiction of the parties before him.

Second, there is no constitutional right to a visa or a right of immigration or emigration. A quick recap of key Supreme Court decisions explains why. Aliens “outside the country receive no constitutional protection.” The Supreme Court repeatedly held an alien seeking initial admission to the United States “requests a privilege, and has no constitutional rights regarding his application, for the power to admit or exclude aliens is a sovereign prerogative.” Thus, the President “may shut out aliens” whenever the President determine such “entry would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States.”

Congress expressly authorized this Presidential action in the one statute the Ninth Circuit tried to hid in its prior decision, cited above at 8 U.S.C. 1182. The actions of the President in respect of enforcing this law “are largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference.” This is because the Constitution entrusts “the power regulate immigration” exclusively “to the political branches of the Federal Government.” As the Supreme Court recently reiterated during Clinton’s presidency: judicial “deference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context” given the “sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations.”

Admission into America is a privilege, not a right. Congress gave the President broad statutory authority to exclude any aliens he saw fit to. A full recitation of that law is useful, because it is the one law the Hawaii judge, like the Ninth Circuit, hid from:

(f)Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. Whenever the Attorney General finds that a commercial airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attorney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection of fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the United States (including the training of personnel in such detection), the Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all aliens transported to the United States by such airline.

The law is clear in the power it gives the President, in the statute cited above — 8 U.S.C. 1182(f). Like the Ninth Circuit decision before, the Hawaii judge goes out of his way to pretend this statute does not exist. Indeed, it is never addressed in any real way in the court’s entire opinion (much of which appeared pre-written prior to the oral argument).

Just as we have a right to decide which strangers enter our home and who sleeps next to our daughters’ bedroom or eats our family’s food, we as a country enjoy the democratic right to decide who enters our country, who lives next to us as a neighbor, and who enjoys the fruits of our ancestral inheritance. The Hawaii Obama judge went much further in the opposite direction: he claimed an immigrant here has a right to bring in whatever other immigrants he wants, even citizens from terror-riddled, Sharia-law-supporting, failed, corrupted states that cannot vet or screen would-be aliens entering America. Ask San Bernardino how that worked out.

Third, the First Amendment does not apply to foreign aliens. That is how we kept terror-minded anarchists out of the nation and sabotage-minded communists out of the nation. That is how every President for more than a century limited migrants based on ideology or statehood. That is why we were much more successful than Europe in limiting the anarchist-inspired violence (that led Europe into World War I) and in limiting communist internal sabotage (that led much of eastern Europe into communist totalitarianism).

Every federal court followed that process in limiting immigration from Muslim-terror nations after 9/11. This Hawaii court’s decision directly conflicts with those Circuits; but, per usual, it never even mentions any of those authorities. As the Second Circuit noted: “one major threat of terrorist attacks comes from radical Islamic groups. The September 11 attacks were facilitated by violations of immigration laws by aliens from predominantly Muslim nations. The Program was clearly tailored to those facts.” This court’s ruling would overturn all of that, and basically claims every president since Teddy Roosevelt violated the First Amendment in our immigration policies.

Put simply, the Hawaii federal judge ruled that because the imam was Muslim and his would-be migrant visas wish-list came from Muslim-dominant nations, the First Amendment gave him a special right to bring whomever he wanted into the country, even from terror-riddled countries in security compromised states the President recognized as a direct threat to the peace of the people.

The First Amendment has never applied to a right of immigration of foreign aliens, nor does it compel religious favoritism toward Muslims. This is the new left’s interpretation of the Constitution, and it is as perilous to our politics as the deep state within and radical Islam abroad.

The Hawaii Obama judge didn’t interpret the Constitution; he rewrote it, usurping to himself the sole power to control borders, then delegated the exercise of that power to a Muslim imam and his free visa wish list. The judge dishonored the rule of law in his order and disrespected our legal traditions and governing legal authorities in his reasoning for it. He effectively declared himself king and executioner.

Meet the new left’s America: foreigners first, Muslims preferred, law last, elections irrelevant.

That is why the Supreme Court reversed a California judge’s order just like this Hawaii judge’s order — imposing a national ban beyond his limited district jurisdiction of the parties before him.

Second, there is no constitutional right to a visa or a right of immigration or emigration. A quick recap of key Supreme Court decisions explains why. Aliens “outside the country receive no constitutional protection.” The Supreme Court repeatedly held an alien seeking initial admission to the United States “requests a privilege, and has no constitutional rights regarding his application, for the power to admit or exclude aliens is a sovereign prerogative.” Thus, the President “may shut out aliens” whenever the President determine such “entry would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States.”

Congress expressly authorized this Presidential action in the one statute the Ninth Circuit tried to hid in its prior decision, cited above at 8 U.S.C. 1182. The actions of the President in respect of enforcing this law “are largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference.” This is because the Constitution entrusts “the power regulate immigration” exclusively “to the political branches of the Federal Government.” As the Supreme Court recently reiterated during Clinton’s presidency: judicial “deference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context” given the “sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations.”

Admission into America is a privilege, not a right. Congress gave the President broad statutory authority to exclude any aliens he saw fit to. A full recitation of that law is useful, because it is the one law the Hawaii judge, like the Ninth Circuit, hid from:

(f)Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. Whenever the Attorney General finds that a commercial airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attorney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection of fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the United States (including the training of personnel in such detection), the Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all aliens transported to the United States by such airline.

The law is clear in the power it gives the President, in the statute cited above — 8 U.S.C. 1182(f). Like the Ninth Circuit decision before, the Hawaii judge goes out of his way to pretend this statute does not exist. Indeed, it is never addressed in any real way in the court’s entire opinion (much of which appeared pre-written prior to the oral argument).

Just as we have a right to decide which strangers enter our home and who sleeps next to our daughters’ bedroom or eats our family’s food, we as a country enjoy the democratic right to decide who enters our country, who lives next to us as a neighbor, and who enjoys the fruits of our ancestral inheritance. The Hawaii Obama judge went much further in the opposite direction: he claimed an immigrant here has a right to bring in whatever other immigrants he wants, even citizens from terror-riddled, Sharia-law-supporting, failed, corrupted states that cannot vet or screen would-be aliens entering America. Ask San Bernardino how that worked out.

Third, the First Amendment does not apply to foreign aliens. That is how we kept terror-minded anarchists out of the nation and sabotage-minded communists out of the nation. That is how every President for more than a century limited migrants based on ideology or statehood. That is why we were much more successful than Europe in limiting the anarchist-inspired violence (that led Europe into World War I) and in limiting communist internal sabotage (that led much of eastern Europe into communist totalitarianism).

Every federal court followed that process in limiting immigration from Muslim-terror nations after 9/11. This Hawaii court’s decision directly conflicts with those Circuits; but, per usual, it never even mentions any of those authorities. As the Second Circuit noted: “one major threat of terrorist attacks comes from radical Islamic groups. The September 11 attacks were facilitated by violations of immigration laws by aliens from predominantly Muslim nations. The Program was clearly tailored to those facts.” This court’s ruling would overturn all of that, and basically claims every president since Teddy Roosevelt violated the First Amendment in our immigration policies.

Put simply, the Hawaii federal judge ruled that because the imam was Muslim and his would-be migrant visas wish-list came from Muslim-dominant nations, the First Amendment gave him a special right to bring whomever he wanted into the country, even from terror-riddled countries in security compromised states the President recognized as a direct threat to the peace of the people.

The First Amendment has never applied to a right of immigration of foreign aliens, nor does it compel religious favoritism toward Muslims. This is the new left’s interpretation of the Constitution, and it is as perilous to our politics as the deep state within and radical Islam abroad.

The Hawaii Obama judge didn’t interpret the Constitution; he rewrote it, usurping to himself the sole power to control borders, then delegated the exercise of that power to a Muslim imam and his free visa wish list. The judge dishonored the rule of law in his order and disrespected our legal traditions and governing legal authorities in his reasoning for it. He effectively declared himself king and executioner.

Meet the new left’s America: foreigners first, Muslims preferred, law last, elections irrelevant.

He is arguing that the charges against him have nothing to do with the original purpose of the special counsel investigation. He is right, but this is Washington.

ADVERTISEMENT

Now fast forward five months to Oct. 27, 2017 when Mueller brought down the first indictments in the investigation. The indictment of Manafort and his former partner Richard Gates include 12 counts of conspiracy, money laundering, being an unregistered foreign agent, and failure to pay taxes. All of those crimes allegedly occurred before the campaign and focus on Manafort’s shady business ties.

Manafort is not claiming that the underlying acts are not crimes but that Mueller would not have found them if he stayed focused on Russian collusion. Again, he is probably right, but this is Washington, Paul. It is like complaining about the weather. The long-standing lament in Washington is “One day on the cover of Time, next day doing time.” When you rise above the crowd, everyone gets a long and close look. Manafort is one of those figures who looks much better from afar than close up.

The question for the court is less likely to be where these crimes are related to Russian collusion, but rather whether it really matters. Many of us noted that the Mueller mandate was especially broad. Rosenstein’s primary language is not the problem. He defined the scope of the investigation as “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.”

He also added that Mueller could investigate “any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a) — including perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.” That is broad but not undefined. However, he then added eleven words that made that narrow construction irrelevant in allowing Mueller to investigate “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.” That is like confining commercial fishing to a 100 mile radius “unless any fish are spotted outside of the zone” — whether it is a foot or thousand miles.

Independent counsel investigations have been previously challenged for this type of mission creep, particularly the Whitewater investigation that began with a shady real estate deal in Arkansas and ended with a stained blue dress in Washington. The original mandate given to Robert Fiske and later Ken Starr was fairly specific and well-defined at the time of his appointment.

Fiske understood that he was confined to “investigate whether any individuals or entities have committed a violation of any federal criminal law relating in any way to President William Jefferson Clinton’s or Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton’s relationships with Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association, Whitewater Development Corporation, or Capital Management Services.” However, that mandate also included the right to investigate “any federal criminal law by any person or entity developed during the independent counsel’s investigation referred to above and connected with or arising out of that investigation.”

Starr would seek an expansion of his authority and receive that expansion from the judicial panel. The time and scope of the investigation led irate members of Congress to block the renewal of the independent counsel law. Such investigations in the future would be handled by a new independent counsel guideline. However, those investigations continued with the same killer catch-all provisions that made limitations virtually irrelevant.

For example, in 2003, Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed to investigate leaks that led to the public identification of former CIA officer Valerie Plame. His mandate would seem comfortably narrow given the very specific disclosure of this one CIA officer. However, the mandate included the “plenary” powers and “all the authority of the Attorney General.” The man who signed that sweeping appointment was James Comey.

Faced with challenges to these unlimited mandates, courts have deferred to the prosecutors and Congress in confining the scope of criminal investigations. For example, when Starr handed down indictments against James McDougal, Susan McDougal, and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, they challenged his mandate. Even though none of the defendants were named in the original appointment, the court said that Starr had the authority to pursue them for crimes that were uncovered by his investigation. The court found that there was “no question” that the indictments “involved the subject matter” of the appointment.

Manafort can argue that, unlike the Whitewater case, his charges are not on the same planet, let alone the same continent. However, there was ample reason for Mueller to investigate Manafort’s finances to look for foreign influence in business arrangements preceding or during the election. He found crimes unrelated to the Russians but they are still properly alleged crimes.

Manafort insists that Mueller’s “appointment order purports to grant authority to the special counsel to expand the scope of his investigation to new matters without the consent of — indeed, without even consulting — any politically accountable officer of the United States.” However, Rosenstein retains the authority to limit that authority or seek the termination of Mueller.

Just after midnight on December 1, World AIDS Day, I learned that President George Herbert Walker Bush had died. And I was dismayed not just that the hagiography afforded dead presidents would overshadow Bush’s own appalling legacy on AIDS, but that his death would eclipse the tens of millions of lives we should be remembering today. Ad Policy

When I teach AIDS history, I always show a clip of ACT UP’s October 11, 1992, “ashes action” at the White House, in which brave activists took the cremated bodies of loved ones who had died of AIDS and hurled them onto Bush’s lawn. (If you’ve never seen it, I dare you to watch without crying).

The ashes action is brilliant not just for how raw it was but also for how it held a powerful man to account without civility. (ACT UP had also gone to Bush’s vacation home in Maine, and they hounded him up until the night he lost reelection, when they marched the dead body of Mark Fisher to his campaign headquarters.) For in life—and, sadly, in the first obits, in death—Bush dangerously hid the vast nature of American violence beneath the seductive cloak of civility, that opiate of mass media that gets journalists and readers to let violence go unremarked.

But at a presidential debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot the day after the ashes action, journalist John Mashek asked Bush:

Mr. President, yesterday tens of thousands of people paraded past the White House to demonstrate about their concern about the disease, AIDS. A celebrated member of your commission, Magic Johnson, quit, saying there was too much inaction. Where is this widespread feeling coming from that your administration is not doing enough about AIDS?

Looking annoyed, Bush listed what his administration was doing before saying, seemingly irritated, “I can’t tell you where it’s coming from. I am very much concerned about AIDS. And I believe we have the best researchers in the world at NIH working on the problem.” But then he added:

It’s one of the few diseases where behavior matters. And I once called on somebody, “Well, change your behavior! If the behavior you’re using is prone to cause AIDs, change the behavior!” Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is saying, “Bush ought to change his behavior!” You can’t talk about it rationally! Current Issue View our current issue

Bush’s words are not just cruel; they fundamentally misunderstand what causes AIDS and how to effectively address it. Sex—yes, even gay sex—is a part of being human, and the people who died of AIDS did so because of societal neglect, not because of their human acts. And while he was nominally better than his predecessor (a very low bar) at addressing the consequences of AIDS, he’d been unforgivably quiet as Reagan’s vice president.

But as director of the CIA, vice president, and then president, Bush exacerbated the material conditions that allow AIDS to flourish in the first place. For what causes AIDS? And why has it always so disparately affected black people? Medical research and pharmaceutical interventions are important in dealing with the consequences of seroconversion and limiting onward transmission of HIV. But AIDS is caused by broader social problems: homelessness, inadequate access to to health care, political instability, racism, homophobia, and the violence of capitalism. And on these fronts, Bush is guilty; his “behavior matters.” As a former head of the CIA, Bush created political instability in nations around the globe where AIDS would thrive. He hyped up racism with his Willie Horton ad, by replacing civil-rights titan Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court with Clarence Thomas, and by vetoing the Civil Rights Act of 1990.

And, of course, in starting the 1991 Iraq War, he set our country on a nearly three-decade-long disaster which has left millions sick, disabled, and dead—many of them LGBTQ soldiers and civilians.

Sadly, gay journalists have been among the worst to immediately whitewash this part of Bush’s legacy. Frank Bruni published a gushing New York Times column on World AIDS Day (“George H.W. Bush’s Uncommon Grace”) without mentioning the words “gay,” “homosexual,” AIDS, or HIV. Meanwhile, over at the gay magazine the Advocate, Neal Broverman headlined his insipid revisionism “George H.W. Bush, No Ally But No Enemy of LGBTQ People, Dead at 94.” Related Article Fidel Castro, 1926–2016 Greg Grandin

The American desire for civility is so strong that many liberals who were enraged that Trump nominated and stood by Brett Kavanaugh have been silent that Bush nominated and stood by Clarence Thomas. Even in the Me Too era, many seem to be eliding that Bush was recently accused of groping women (while allegedly declaring “I’m David Cop-A-Feel!”).

On World AIDS Day, it would be an unforgivable injury to those who died of AIDS because of Bush’s actions and inactions to let him off the hook. Instead, look at what drove grieving lovers and friends to pour ashes onto Bush’s lawn—and really sit with the violence of American empire embodied by George Herbert Walker Bush.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

599.0,"The EU and NATO and Trump — Oh My!

It is no secret that U.S. President Donald Trump has an instinctive animus against the European Union and NATO. He supported the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom, reportedly advised French President Emmanuel Macron that his country should leave the union too, and last week falsely claimed that the EU was created “to take advantage of the United States.” (This last statement raises an obvious question: Does Trump know any history at all? The answer appears to be no.) He has long complained that NATO’s European members aren’t paying enough for defense and has offered only tepid support for the mutual defense clause that is at the heart of the NATO treaty.

So, it’s not surprising that both Europeans and Americans are now looking ahead to the NATO summit in July with a certain foreboding. Coming on the heels of Trump’s petulant tantrums during and after the G-7 summit in June, and taking place just before he is scheduled to meet one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the summit could turn out to be the diplomatic equivalent of a 29-car pileup.

Unfortunately, Trump’s evident distaste for these institutions mostly reveals his own ignorance and lack of strategic acumen. Why? Because there is a connection between U.S. interests, its commitment to NATO, and the strength of the EU. Although a good case can be made for gradually reducing the U.S. role in Europe and letting Europeans handle their own defense, moving in that direction actually makes the EU more rather than less important, because it plays an important role in keeping Europe peaceful and prosperous. If Trump wants to do less for NATO, in short, he should be embracing the EU instead of denigrating it.

The U.S. interest in Europe is fairly straightforward. In addition to their mutually beneficial trade and investment relations, the United States has long sought to preserve an overall balance of power in Europe. Washington did not want any single country to dominate Europe, or unify it under its leadership, because a regional hegemon of this sort would be a peer competitor and might eventually try to establish a substantial security role in the Western Hemisphere and force Americans to worry more about defending their own shores. The United States intervened in World War I and World War II to prevent Germany from establishing hegemony in Europe, and it kept more than 200,000 troops in Europe during the Cold War to keep the Soviet Union from attempting the same thing.

There is no potential hegemon in Europe today, however — neither Germany nor Russia has the population, economic strength, and military clout to take over the whole place — and thus there is no serious threat to the regional balance of power. Thus, the United States could (and should) reduce its military role and gradually turn European security back to the Europeans.

But the United States still has a continuing interest in peace in Europe, partly for economic reasons, but mostly so that Americans don’t have to spend much time worrying about that region and can focus on areas — most notably Asia — where the balance of power is more delicate and a potential regional hegemon, China, is apparent. For this reason, the U.S. role in Europe should be reduced gradually and in a cooperative spirit, so that NATO’s European members have time to adjust. Trump’s bull-in-a-china-shop approach to diplomacy is exactly the wrong way to proceed.

And that’s where the EU comes in. The European Union and its predecessors were not created to rip the United States off, as Trump claims, but rather to help Western Europe generate the economic strength needed to stand up to the Soviet Union and to make war between Europe’s separate states unlikely-to-unthinkable. Given that the United States still has an interest in a tranquil Europe, a strong EU would be even more valuable if the U.S. security role in Europe were to decline.

Moreover, from a U.S. perspective, the present level of integration in the EU is close to ideal. If the EU were a true “United States of Europe” with a single national capital, a federal system of government, and a fully integrated fiscal union, military forces, and diplomatic service, then it would in fact be a third pole in world politics and a potential peer competitor. Relations with the United States would be far more competitive, and the impact on world affairs would be profound.

But the EU is far short of becoming a single state and probably never will. Nationalism remains a powerful force in Europe, and there are vast differences between the various members. If anything, in fact, recent trends are running the other way. At present, therefore, the EU is just united enough to help stabilize the continent but not so unified as to be able to speak with a single voice and pose a serious challenge to U.S. interests.

For this reason, Trump’s simultaneous opposition to the EU and skepticism about NATO is both short-sighted and contradictory. He seems to think getting out of NATO would save the United States lots of money, though that wouldn’t be the case if the Pentagon just decided to spend it on other missions, and that helping destroy the EU would let the United States impose one-sided “deals” on its members. The latter step is unlikely; more important, unraveling the EU would accelerate the renationalization of European foreign policy and reignite security competition there, which would in turn force the United States to pay more attention to Europe than if Europe remained loosely unified and therefore mostly tranquil.

This brings us to the upcoming meeting with Putin. Unlike those who see the Russian president as the prince of darkness or Trump’s puppet master, I think 1) the West deserves an equal share of the blame for the deteriorating relationship, 2) it would be good if relations could be repaired, and 3) in the abstract, it makes good sense for Trump to talk directly to him to see if No. 2 can be achieved. If Trump were smart, however, and interested in a striking a good deal with Putin, he would want to show up in Helsinki later this month with a successful NATO summit and a united alliance behind him. This situation would give him maximum leverage and force Putin to match any U.S. offers with concessions of his own. By contrast, if Trump showed up with NATO in disarray, Putin would have already achieved a core strategic goal and would have little reason to do Trump any favors.

But as Mark Landler of the New York Times recently noted, Trump’s pattern of behavior thus far is the exact opposite. Instead of aggressively bargaining with foreign leaders, he simply offers autocrats unilateral concessions and get nothing but a photo-op in return. As befits an uncontrollable narcissist and former reality TV show host, Trump cares more about getting a big audience than getting good deals. He knows the world will be watching him in Helsinki — just as it was watching when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore — and he probably also knows that you get bigger ratings by meeting with ruthless but colorful dictators than with the polite, well-meaning, democratically elected, and often boring presidents or prime ministers of America’s longtime allies. The national interest is irrelevant; it’s the Nielsen ratings that count.

By Trump’s standards, in short, his meeting with Putin will be successful simply by occurring, even if the famously disciplined Russian leader picks Trump’s pocket just as nimbly as Kim did.

What can head off this looming train wreck, now that Trump is by most accounts less interested in expert advice and increasingly inclined to trust his own flawed instincts? I don’t know, but we do know that the president is very sensitive to criticism and hates to be made fun of. If I were trying to steer him in the right direction, I’d tell him I was worried that leaders like Kim, Xi Jinping, and Putin were starting to laugh at his diplomatic naiveté, and that the only way to stop their snickering would be to spend a few days acting like a statesman rather than a stooge.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

It is no secret that U.S. President Donald Trump has an instinctive animus against the European Union and NATO. He supported the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom, reportedly advised French President Emmanuel Macron that his country should leave the union too, and last week falsely claimed that the EU was created “to take advantage of the United States.” (This last statement raises an obvious question: Does Trump know any history at all? The answer appears to be no.) He has long complained that NATO’s European members aren’t paying enough for defense and has offered only tepid support for the mutual defense clause that is at the heart of the NATO treaty.

So, it’s not surprising that both Europeans and Americans are now looking ahead to the NATO summit in July with a certain foreboding. Coming on the heels of Trump’s petulant tantrums during and after the G-7 summit in June, and taking place just before he is scheduled to meet one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the summit could turn out to be the diplomatic equivalent of a 29-car pileup.

Unfortunately, Trump’s evident distaste for these institutions mostly reveals his own ignorance and lack of strategic acumen. Why? Because there is a connection between U.S. interests, its commitment to NATO, and the strength of the EU. Although a good case can be made for gradually reducing the U.S. role in Europe and letting Europeans handle their own defense, moving in that direction actually makes the EU more rather than less important, because it plays an important role in keeping Europe peaceful and prosperous. If Trump wants to do less for NATO, in short, he should be embracing the EU instead of denigrating it.

The U.S. interest in Europe is fairly straightforward. In addition to their mutually beneficial trade and investment relations, the United States has long sought to preserve an overall balance of power in Europe. Washington did not want any single country to dominate Europe, or unify it under its leadership, because a regional hegemon of this sort would be a peer competitor and might eventually try to establish a substantial security role in the Western Hemisphere and force Americans to worry more about defending their own shores. The United States intervened in World War I and World War II to prevent Germany from establishing hegemony in Europe, and it kept more than 200,000 troops in Europe during the Cold War to keep the Soviet Union from attempting the same thing.

There is no potential hegemon in Europe today, however — neither Germany nor Russia has the population, economic strength, and military clout to take over the whole place — and thus there is no serious threat to the regional balance of power. Thus, the United States could (and should) reduce its military role and gradually turn European security back to the Europeans.

625.0,"The coronavirus has yet again exposed the strong contrast between President Trump – who is working ardently for the American people – and a Democratic Party with little interest in anything besides taking him down.

President Trump, for his part, has taken unprecedented action to thwart the spread of the virus.

The president issued a travel ban to stop the spread of the virus by travelers from affected regions, announcing additional travel restrictions during a Saturday news conference.

PERSON DIES FROM CORONAVIRUS IN WASHINGTON STATE, FIRST IN THE US, HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY

Trump announced mandatory quarantines and a public health emergency. And he formed a Coronavirus Task Force and appointed Vice President Mike Pence to lead the effort to orchestrate a coronavirus response.

Meanwhile, Democrats and the anti-Trump media have done little more than complain, point fingers, and politicize what should be an issue engendering bipartisan response.

Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., falsely accused the president of having no plan to deal with the coronavirus, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issuing a 52-page planned response.

Some 60 percent of CNN’s questions to coronavirus-related guests invited criticism of the Trump presidency. Further exposing its bias, CNN cut away from President Trump’s news conference on the coronavirus to televise flailing Democratic candidate Mike Bloomberg’s presidential town hall.

The New York Times published a column by Gail Collins that dubbed the coronavirus the “Trumpvirus.” The newspaper’s continually wrong economics columnist Paul Krugman appeared to celebrate fall in the stock market.

Recall that Krugman predicted “a global recession, with no end in sight” if Donald Trump was elected president. In reality, Trump’s election spurred a period of continued growth and the hottest economy in modern history.

The left’s panic and politicization of the coronavirus is not unusual. It is the typical reaction for a party and a media hoping desperately to see the end of the Trump presidency.

Liberal Democrats peddled an unfounded conspiracy theory alleging Trump-Russia collusion, only to be rebuked by Special Counsel Robert Mueller nearly two years later.

Liberal Democrats then spun a Ukraine quid pro quo theory, which ended in the Senate’s exoneration of President Trump.

And then, when the yield curve was momentarily inverted at the end of 2019, the media broke into utter and sheer panic, suggesting a recession was on the horizon.

In fact, the Trump economy continued to boom with new home sales reaching the highest level in over 12 years, consumer confidence in the economy continuing to break records, and paychecks rising fastest for low- and middle-income Americans.

Rather than politicizing the coronavirus and myriad other situations, Democrats should work on a bipartisan basis with the president to solve them.

As President Trump aptly noted Saturday: “We would respectfully ask the media and politicians and everybody else involved not do anything to incite panic because there’s no reason to panic at all. This is something that is being handled professionally.”

Indeed, President Trump has proven himself the professional – the adult in the room as Democrats act like small children, incapable of stepping up to the task at hand and certainly incapable of leading the nation.

Let the coronavirus and the Democratic response be a clear sign that America simply cannot afford a Democrat prevailing in the presidential election in November.

640.0,"This is the “Die Another Day” of its franchise — an empty shell of its former self that disrespects its own proud heritage at every turn.

The first 10 minutes of “The Fate of the Furious” have everything that you could ever ask for in a “Fast and the Furious” movie, or any other movie for that matter. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) swaggers through the streets of Havana, tasting the local flavor as a bass-heavy Cuban pop song bangs on the soundtrack. The sun is shining, the cars are classics, and the girls are wearing hot pink thongs that make their butts pop off the screen like they’ve been post-converted into 3D. It’s like someone threw a Pitbull video and forgot to invite him.

Then, as Dom comes across a weirdly well-organized group of local auto fetishists, he finds his younger cousin being antagonized by the baddest guy in town. But there’s an easy solution to this problem. You see, Dom lives by a code, and that code is simple: “All human conflict can be resolved by a rigged street race between two hilariously mismatched vehicles.”

So they race, the Cuban dude in a souped up beauty, and Dom in a rustbucket that hasn’t been touched since the Bay of Pigs — all the better for him to growl that it “doesn’t matter what’s under the hood.” A few pyrotechnics and a shot of NOS later, and a mob of smiling kids is surrounding Dom like he’s brought them all candy. The loser surrenders his keys: “You win my car, and you win my respect.” They’re brothers now. Dom throws an arm around his wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Fidel Castro rolls in his grave, and the title card skids onto the screen.

Welcome back to the ever-expanding world of the Fast and the Furious, where family comes first, physics comes a distant second, and logic blew a flat tire like three movies ago. What started in 2001 as a modestly budgeted “Point Break” ripoff has exploded into one a box office behemoth the size of James Bond, and Dom’s crew has evolved from a gang of low-rent gearheads into an international unit of government-funded super spies or something.

And that’s awesome. Where these movies are going, they don’t need roads. Or scripts. Or any pressing reason to exist. Sure, the last two installments of this hi-octane soap opera have fallen well short of the nigh-perfect “Fast Five,” and it’s increasingly clear that “Tokyo Drift” will never be topped for sheer personality (or sick drifting, natch), but the series has weathered all sorts of ridiculousness — even amnesia! — because it’s never betrayed the fundamental bonds that hold it together.

Until now.

“F8” is the worst of these films since “2 Fast 2 Furious,” and it may be even worse than that. It’s the “Die Another Day” of its franchise — an empty, generic shell of its former self that disrespects its own proud heritage at every turn. How did the great F. Gary Gray, whose surprisingly strong remake of “The Italian Job” displayed a tremendous flair for comedic vehicular mayhem, waste the biggest budget of his career on such boring smash-ups? How did Diesel and co. manage to learn all of the wrong lessons from the last two movies, delivering an episode where everything feels so fake that even the “family” matters seem forced?

It stalls the moment Charlize Theron shows up. As dull and uninspired here as she was riveting and iconic in “Fury Road,” Theron plays Cipher, an embarrassingly named super hacker who plunges “F8” into the most half-assed story of cyber-terrorism since “Live Free or Die Hard.” The franchise’s first female baddie, Cipher is regrettably also its least interesting — her villainous plot is so stupid that the film tries to pretend it doesn’t matter, and most of Theron’s performance is confined to cut-away shots where she says things like “Get ready for this” before hitting a button that triggers some bad special effects halfway around the world. Yeah, she has a henchman from “Game of Thrones” (Kristofer Hivju), but who doesn’t these days?

READ MORE: Universal Surprises With ‘Fate Of The Furious’ Screening At Cinema-Con

Anyway, Cipher blackmails Dom into her employ by showing him some very incriminating information on a tablet (cause she’s a hacker!), and while we’re left in the dark for much of the film’s first half, part of the fun is trying to imagine what could possibly convince Dom to turn against his family. The reveal itself is a satisfying exploitation of the character’s weakness; it’s one of the few details of Chris Morgan’s screenplay that doesn’t feel like it was written on auto-pilot.

But the buildup to it is a slog, and the fact that Dom doesn’t simply tell his pals what’s going on — rather than running them off the road and stealing a massive EMP bomb — is perhaps the dumbest thing that happens in the entire movie (and this is a movie in which Vin Diesel drives a muscle car over a nuclear submarine).

But while Dom’s betrayal of his friends is obviously temporary, his betrayal of their franchise cuts much deeper. From its greasy analog origins to its plastic digital present, The “Fast and the Furious” saga has managed to speed right over any bumps in the road because every new adventure has held true to the core belief that loyalty supersedes everything else, including the law.

That’s why a criminal like Dom could forge such an unlikely bond with a cop like Brian O’Conner, and that’s why the series has organically been able to accommodate so many new cast members (most of whom are squeezed into this movie as interchangeable sources of exposition and comic relief) — if Dom gave his nod of approval, audiences were happy to welcome them into the fold. It’s why Dom instantly overlooked the fact that Letty was brainwashed by some bad guys, and it’s why Dom grunted “Words ain’t even been invented yet” when someone asked him what he was going to do to the people who killed Han.

Not so fast (not so furious). It turns out that words have been invented already, and those words are: “Host a lovely barbecue for them on my roof deck.” Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw makes for some of the most fun moments in “F8” (the best of which is too good to spoil), but the ease with which Dom’s pals allow the “Furious 7” villain into their club is not only a fatal misread of what fans loved about these films, it’s also a tacit admission that their sentiments are as fake as their stunts. Han is never even mentioned. It’s nice that Paul Walker gets to live on through these movies — his unseen character is still chilling on a beach somewhere — but the actor’s death has eliminated the last remaining failsafes that were preventing this franchise from forgetting what it’s all about, and “F8” sends the entire enterprise careening towards a full-blown identity crisis.

It’s telling that Diesel and Dwayne Johnson virtually never appear onscreen together, because at no point does it feel like Gray’s sprawling cast of characters is all in the same film. Dom is in a Hitchcockian thriller, Johnson and Statham are in a balls-out buddy comedy, Theron is in the “Swordfish” sequel that no one wanted, and Tyrese Gibson and Chris Bridges are wisecracking about the whole thing in the distant background. Whereas the previous movies were galvanized by a very real sense of camaraderie, “The Fate of the Furious” is more disjointed than a ten-car pileup, and just about as much fun. This family has officially become dysfunctional.

And while the problems might originate with the human stuff, the fallout is most obvious during the lifeless action scenes. The film’s signature stunt finds the gang racing through the streets of Manhattan, chasing after a Russian diplomat because… don’t worry about it. But Cipher, safely tucked away in the military airplane where her character spends most of her time, hacks into every car in New York City, reprogramming them like the polygonal renderings that they are and flinging them across midtown in perfect formation (“It’s zombie time,” she says as she presses the magic button). They pour through the streets like a tidal wave, the obvious CG distracting from the fact that half of the sequence was clearly shot in Cleveland.

As much a mess of conflicting tones and styles as it is of locations, this setpiece — like the rest of Gray’s movie — feels like a heap of random parts that were thrown together in the hopes that fate might somehow weld them into a roadworthy vehicle. It’s exhausting.

“F8” may be a good 20 minutes shorter than either of the last two chapters, but the parade of dull action beats make the movie feel as long as the never-ending runway from “Fast and Furious 6.” Only the climax, split between Siberia and the stratosphere, displays the cartoonish ingenuity required to take advantage of the “anything goes” tone — it’s so dumb that it almost swings back around to being smart again. Almost. By the time we arrive at the film’s festive final moments, the underlying problem is painfully clear: It’s not just that this franchise has lost any sense of itself, it’s that “The Fate of the Furious” doesn’t find anything to replace it with.

But the buildup to it is a slog, and the fact that Dom doesn’t simply tell his pals what’s going on — rather than running them off the road and stealing a massive EMP bomb — is perhaps the dumbest thing that happens in the entire movie (and this is a movie in which Vin Diesel drives a muscle car over a nuclear submarine).

But while Dom’s betrayal of his friends is obviously temporary, his betrayal of their franchise cuts much deeper. From its greasy analog origins to its plastic digital present, The “Fast and the Furious” saga has managed to speed right over any bumps in the road because every new adventure has held true to the core belief that loyalty supersedes everything else, including the law.

That’s why a criminal like Dom could forge such an unlikely bond with a cop like Brian O’Conner, and that’s why the series has organically been able to accommodate so many new cast members (most of whom are squeezed into this movie as interchangeable sources of exposition and comic relief) — if Dom gave his nod of approval, audiences were happy to welcome them into the fold. It’s why Dom instantly overlooked the fact that Letty was brainwashed by some bad guys, and it’s why Dom grunted “Words ain’t even been invented yet” when someone asked him what he was going to do to the people who killed Han.

Not so fast (not so furious). It turns out that words have been invented already, and those words are: “Host a lovely barbecue for them on my roof deck.” Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw makes for some of the most fun moments in “F8” (the best of which is too good to spoil), but the ease with which Dom’s pals allow the “Furious 7” villain into their club is not only a fatal misread of what fans loved about these films, it’s also a tacit admission that their sentiments are as fake as their stunts. Han is never even mentioned. It’s nice that Paul Walker gets to live on through these movies — his unseen character is still chilling on a beach somewhere — but the actor’s death has eliminated the last remaining failsafes that were preventing this franchise from forgetting what it’s all about, and “F8” sends the entire enterprise careening towards a full-blown identity crisis.

It’s telling that Diesel and Dwayne Johnson virtually never appear onscreen together, because at no point does it feel like Gray’s sprawling cast of characters is all in the same film. Dom is in a Hitchcockian thriller, Johnson and Statham are in a balls-out buddy comedy, Theron is in the “Swordfish” sequel that no one wanted, and Tyrese Gibson and Chris Bridges are wisecracking about the whole thing in the distant background. Whereas the previous movies were galvanized by a very real sense of camaraderie, “The Fate of the Furious” is more disjointed than a ten-car pileup, and just about as much fun. This family has officially become dysfunctional.

And while the problems might originate with the human stuff, the fallout is most obvious during the lifeless action scenes. The film’s signature stunt finds the gang racing through the streets of Manhattan, chasing after a Russian diplomat because… don’t worry about it. But Cipher, safely tucked away in the military airplane where her character spends most of her time, hacks into every car in New York City, reprogramming them like the polygonal renderings that they are and flinging them across midtown in perfect formation (“It’s zombie time,” she says as she presses the magic button). They pour through the streets like a tidal wave, the obvious CG distracting from the fact that half of the sequence was clearly shot in Cleveland.

As much a mess of conflicting tones and styles as it is of locations, this setpiece — like the rest of Gray’s movie — feels like a heap of random parts that were thrown together in the hopes that fate might somehow weld them into a roadworthy vehicle. It’s exhausting.

“F8” may be a good 20 minutes shorter than either of the last two chapters, but the parade of dull action beats make the movie feel as long as the never-ending runway from “Fast and Furious 6.” Only the climax, split between Siberia and the stratosphere, displays the cartoonish ingenuity required to take advantage of the “anything goes” tone — it’s so dumb that it almost swings back around to being smart again. Almost. By the time we arrive at the film’s festive final moments, the underlying problem is painfully clear: It’s not just that this franchise has lost any sense of itself, it’s that “The Fate of the Furious” doesn’t find anything to replace it with.

Grade: C-

“The Fate of the Furious” opens in theaters on Friday, April 14.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon-Jae-in will plant a commemorative tree and inspect an honor guard together after Kim walks across the border Friday for their historic summit, Seoul officials said Thursday. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)

Here’s a hard truth that’s certifiable by any rudimentary review of modern Korean history: The real news about Korea catches almost everyone by surprise.

Who, for instance, would have predicted the outbreak of the Korean War nearly seven decades ago? Who knew, in the depths of South Korea’s economic suffering after that titanic tragedy, that the South would burst into bloom as a major industrial power?

And who would have thought, in the darkest moments of military dictatorship under Park Chung-hee and then Chun Doo-hwan, that Korea would emerge as a democracy complete with national, provincial and local elections?

Those are just a few of the many shocks and surprises that have rocked South Korea since the end of Japanese rule in August 1945 and the emergence of the Republic of Korea in the South three years later. The evolution of North Korea, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, founded the next month, has been equally full of surprises, most notoriously its success in producing nuclear warheads and the missiles to send them to distant targets since the late Kim Jong-il ordered the first underground nuclear test in October 2006.

A quick reminder of some of the jolts, for better and for worse, with which most of us in Korea are quite familiar, is by way of getting around to the surprises of the past year and a half.

First, we had the Candlelight Revolution, resulting in the downfall of Park Chung-hee’s daughter Park Geun-hye and the rise of a liberal president, Moon Jae-in. Then, lo and behold, came a stunning reversal of the march toward a second Korean War that seemed possible while Kim Jong-il’s son Kim Jong-un ordered tests of ever more powerful warheads and missiles.

Who would have predicted, as the new year dawned, that Kim III, scion of the dynasty founded by his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, who orchestrated the invasion of the South in June 1950, would have decided enough was enough and send a team, accompanied by several hundred entertainers and Taekwondo wrestlers, to participate in the Pyeongchang Olympics? And who knew he would actually express “willingness” to discuss giving up his nuclear program?

Can all this flurry of news, including the drama of Kim’s announcement of suspension of nuclear-weapons testing, be for real or are we being horribly misled? Will President Moon and “Respected Leader” Kim come up with a magic formula whereby he really does commit himself to giving up the nuclear program, not just suspending it?

We’re so accustomed to disappointment and disillusionment in dealing with North Korea that it’s hard to be optimistic. Maybe we should just be thankful that Moon and Kim are meeting Friday (April 27), and see it as the beginning of an attenuated up-and-down process. For sure, whatever they say or do at Panmunjom, the Moon-Kim dialogue will have a huge effect on whatever happens when President Trump and Kim meet a month or so later.

That’s assuming, of course, that Trump and Kim actually do meet. Trump himself has gone up and down on North Korea like a yo-yo. Was it not just a few months ago that he was threatening to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea? And who can forget his references to Kim as “Rocket Man” and “Little Rocket Man” — the adjective “little” a sneering reminder of Kim’s weight?

Now Trump is reversing field to an extent that has American advocates of reconciliation criticizing him for misleading everyone by saying Kim has already agreed on denuclearization.

Actually, as the usual cast of think-tank analysts and TV yakkers in the swamp of Washington have been loudly noting, Kim has done nothing of the sort. He’s just said he won’t test any more nukes and missiles.

In fact, North Korea hasn’t tested any nukes since its sixth underground test, by far its most powerful, probably a hydrogen bomb, last September. The nuclear test site, which Kim made a show of shutting down, is still functional, according to 38 North, the noted dispenser of inside info about the North’s nuclear and missile program.

Is it not possible, however, to be a little too skeptical if not cynical about North Korea’s assurances and intentions? The reason I ask is we may be in for a surprise, and not all the surprises are bad.

Might Kim have seen the light and decided he has much more to gain, and nothing to lose, by getting along with the South, and with the United States too? In the long history of shocks and surprises, may we dare to fantasize real and lasting peace?

As Moon and Kim meet Friday in Peace House, just south of the North-South line in the Joint Security Area set up in the truce that ended the gunfire in July 1953, the dream lives on.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

695.0,"For all the sound and fury over his public remarks and tweets in Washington, President Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia has been a very different story. The president gave the right speech in the right place at the right time. There will still be critics on issues like human rights and Yemen, but the president had a different focus — and almost certainly the right one.

First, he needed to reassure the Saudis, the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and the other leaders of the 50 some Islamic countries meeting in the Kingdom that he was not anti-Islamic and did not see Islam as an enemy. He did just that — and in ways far more suited to the culture of his audience than the take-no-prisoners rhetoric he often employs in the U.S.

ADVERTISEMENT

The first three paragraphs of his speech thanked his hosts, and talked about “the splendor of your country and the kindness of your citizens.” He mentioned the meeting between President Roosevelt and King Abdulaziz, and then went on to “extend my deep and heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of the distinguished heads of state who made this journey here today. You greatly honor us with your presence, and I send the warmest regards from my country to yours. I know that our time together will bring many blessings to both your people and mine.”

He then went on to say that he stood before them “as a representative of the American People, to deliver a message of friendship and hope. That is why I chose to make my first foreign visit a trip to the heart of the Muslim world, to the nation that serves as custodian of the two holiest sites in the Islamic Faith.” Courtesy and respect don’t make headlines, but they do make friends and strategic partners. They are particularly critical in the Arab world, and particularly important when the speaker sometimes treated all of Islam as an enemy during his campaign and implied that Islam itself might be hostile and extremist.

The president then went on to make it clear that America’s search for strategic partners meant strengthening America’s oldest friendships, which include several Arab states. He promised that “America will not seek to impose our way of life on others, but to outstretch our hands in the spirit of cooperation and trust ... Our goal is a coalition of nations who share the aim of stamping out extremism and providing our children a hopeful future that does honor to God.”

He then stated his respect for Arab history and culture, the need for economic progress, and noted that “Saudi Arabia is home to the holiest sites in one of the world’s great faiths. Each year millions of Muslims come from around the world to Saudi Arabia to take part in the Hajj. In addition to ancient wonders, this country is also home to modern ones — including soaring achievements in architecture.” He mentioned the positive character of one strategic partner after another — reinforcing the importance of the U.S. strategic partnership with that country in the process.

When it came to the core of his speech — the fight against terrorism — the president’s choice in words really mattered. He avoided phrases like “Islamic extremism,” but repeatedly made it clear that the U.S. would focus on the threats posed by “terrorists and extremists.” He carefully avoided the financial aspects of burden sharing — something all too necessary in a Saudi Arabia spending something like three times the percent of its GDP on defense as the U.S. and nearly six times the percentage of the average NATO ally.

But, he was perfectly clear about what he expected from the countries present when he said, “There can be no coexistence with this violence. There can be no tolerating it, no accepting it, no excusing it, and no ignoring it ... America is prepared to stand with you in pursuit of shared interests and common security ... But the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them. The nations of the Middle East will have to decide what kind of future they want for themselves, for their countries, and for their children.”

He went on and said, “A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive them out. Drive them of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy land. And drive them out of this earth ... That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamist extremism and the Islamist terror groups it inspires ... It means standing together against the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians ... . Religious leaders must make this absolutely clear ... And political leaders must speak out to affirm the same idea: heroes don’t kill innocents. They save them.”

These are strong messages, but they are also ones that resonate throughout the Islamic world, and for the reasons the president also stated in his speech, “The deadliest toll has been exacted on the innocent people of Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern nations. They have borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this wave of fanatical violence ... Some estimates hold that more than 95 percent of the victims of terrorism are themselves Muslim.”

He pointed to “a humanitarian and security disaster in this region that is spreading across the planet. It is a tragedy of epic proportions ... The true toll of ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, and so many others, must be counted not only in the number of dead. It must also be counted in generations of vanished dreams.”

These are words that the vast majority of Muslims agree with, and ones that clearly rise above fear, prejudice, and isolationism. They are the values Muslims want in a strategic partner. They do not compromise any aspect of the fight against extremism and terrorism.

President Trump was also careful to emphasize the threat from the Iranian government as another core aspect of the U.S. strategic partnership with the Arab world, but he also focused on the Iranian government and not the Iranian people, many of whom clearly do not support its extremism. He called Iran “a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room ... Among Iran’s most tragic and destabilizing interventions have been in Syria. Bolstered by Iran, Assad has committed unspeakable crimes.”

Many press reports will focus on some $110 billion in arms sales, and the fact that the president not only implied the U.S. would back away from efforts to change Saudi Arabia, but would remain committed to Bahrain, Egypt, Turkey, and a successful outcome in Yemen. The president also touched on trade and investment, and Saudi Arabia’s 2030 plan for reform.

At the same time, he did not dodge the issue of Israel and the need for broad religious tolerance. He said, “For many centuries the Middle East has been home to Christians, Muslims and Jews living side-by-side. We must practice tolerance and respect for each other once again, and make this region a place where every man and woman, no matter their faith or ethnicity, can enjoy a life of dignity and hope ... If these three faiths can join together in cooperation, then peace in this world is possible, including peace between Israelis and Palestinians.”

One speech cannot change Arab or Muslim perceptions of the president or the U.S. as an ally. Much will depend on the years and actions that follow. Words really matter, however, and especially in the Middle East. This time, the president used the right words to start rebuilding the foundations of America’s strategic partnerships in the Muslim world and Middle East, and to deal with truly urgent threats. This speech is the right beginning — in remarkably well-crafted terms — and it deserves bipartisan and expert respect.

Deep State! Witch Hunt! Swamp! NO COLLUSION! Donald Trump's Twitter harangues against Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election have become so common that we are inured to them. Likewise, the denunciations of Mueller by Rudy Giuliani, Devin Nunes, and Sean Hannity can generally be ignored, even when they deliver them in lower-case letters. But when a noted scholar of constitutional law raises similar, though far more rational, arguments, attention must be paid.

Steven Calabresi is chairman of the board of the Federalist Society and the Clayton J. and Henry R. Barber Professor of Law at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law—and, we should add, a friend and colleague of ours.He recently published an op-ed in The Hill, purporting to explain why President Trump has behaved lawfully by demanding a Justice Department investigation of so-called FBI spying, and why Mueller’s own investigation is “unconstitutional.” He is half right, but it is the lesser half.

Calabresi writes:

Many liberals and critics are under the mistaken belief that President Trump is violating the rule of law and civil liberties ... by ordering the Justice Department’s Inspector General to investigate whether or not the FBI spied on his 2016 presidential campaign. In fact, the president is behaving totally lawfully.

This is sleight of hand. Perhaps we missed it, but we know of no serious critic who claims that Trump lacks the legal authority to give orders to the Department of Justice. Rather, the criticism is that he has disregarded the long-standing convention of DOJ independence. A presidential order can be completely lawful in a formal sense, while still endangering “the rule of law and civil liberties.” Calabresi's observation about Trump's power is therefore accurate, but nonetheless a non-sequitur.

Calabresi's second point, however, is just wrong. He argues that Mueller's investigation is unconstitutional because he was “never nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.” He reaches this conclusion by claiming that Mueller is “acting like a U.S. attorney” rather than an assistant and is therefore “a principal officer” who must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. But “acting like” a principal officer has no constitutional meaning and, in any case, Calabresi's only support for this position is that Mueller “is more powerful and famous than are any of the 96 U.S. attorneys.” The factual claim regarding power is dubious, especially in light of Mueller's referral of the Cohen investigation to the Southern District of New York. Moreover, there is no requirement that prosecutors who conduct national investigations be less “powerful” than individual U.S. attorneys. Fame, needless to say, is constitutionally irrelevant.

Calabresi makes his point at somewhat greater length in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, in which he cites Justice Rehnquist’s majority opinion in Morrison v. Olson. That case, however, upheld the authority of a special counsel who had much broader powers than Mueller’s. Calabresi quotes Rehnquist as writing “that independent counsel Alexia Morrison qualified as an ‘inferior officer,’ not subject to the appointment process, because her office was ‘limited in jurisdiction’ to ‘certain federal officials suspected of certain serious federal crimes.’”

Mueller is different, according to Calabresi, because he “is investigating a large number of people and has already charged defendants with many different kinds of crimes.” As it happens, that is an apt description of many investigations under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which was upheld 8-1 by the Rehnquist Court in Morrison. It is axiomatic that a prosecutor does not need to ignore crimes that are discovered in the course of a valid investigation. And of course, Mueller’s subsequent conduct, even if it has been too expansive, would not retroactively invalidate his initial appointment.

Deep State! Witch Hunt! Swamp! NO COLLUSION! Donald Trump's Twitter harangues against Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election have become so common that we are inured to them. Likewise, the denunciations of Mueller by Rudy Giuliani, Devin Nunes, and Sean Hannity can generally be ignored, even when they deliver them in lower-case letters. But when a noted scholar of constitutional law raises similar, though far more rational, arguments, attention must be paid.

Steven Calabresi is chairman of the board of the Federalist Society and the Clayton J. and Henry R. Barber Professor of Law at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law—and, we should add, a friend and colleague of ours.He recently published an op-ed in The Hill, purporting to explain why President Trump has behaved lawfully by demanding a Justice Department investigation of so-called FBI spying, and why Mueller’s own investigation is “unconstitutional.” He is half right, but it is the lesser half.

Calabresi writes:

Many liberals and critics are under the mistaken belief that President Trump is violating the rule of law and civil liberties... by ordering the Justice Department’s Inspector General to investigate whether or not the FBI spied on his 2016 presidential campaign. In fact, the president is behaving totally lawfully.

This is sleight of hand. Perhaps we missed it, but we know of no serious critic who claims that Trump lacks the legal authority to give orders to the Department of Justice. Rather, the criticism is that he has disregarded the long-standing convention of DOJ independence. A presidential order can be completely lawful in a formal sense, while still endangering “the rule of law and civil liberties.” Calabresi's observation about Trump's power is therefore accurate, but nonetheless a non-sequitur.

Calabresi's second point, however, is just wrong. He argues that Mueller's investigation is unconstitutional because he was “never nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.” He reaches this conclusion by claiming that Mueller is “acting like a U.S. attorney” rather than an assistant and is therefore “a principal officer” who must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. But “acting like” a principal officer has no constitutional meaning and, in any case, Calabresi's only support for this position is that Mueller “is more powerful and famous than are any of the 96 U.S. attorneys.” The factual claim regarding power is dubious, especially in light of Mueller's referral of the Cohen investigation to the Southern District of New York. Moreover, there is no requirement that prosecutors who conduct national investigations be less “powerful” than individual U.S. attorneys. Fame, needless to say, is constitutionally irrelevant.

Calabresi makes his point at somewhat greater length in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, in which he cites Justice Rehnquist’s majority opinion in Morrison v. Olson. That case, however, upheld the authority of a special counsel who had much broader powers than Mueller’s. Calabresi quotes Rehnquist as writing “that independent counsel Alexia Morrison qualified as an ‘inferior officer,’ not subject to the appointment process, because her office was ‘limited in jurisdiction’ to ‘certain federal officials suspected of certain serious federal crimes.’”

Mueller is different, according to Calabresi, because he “is investigating a large number of people and has already charged defendants with many different kinds of crimes.” As it happens, that is an apt description of many investigations under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which was upheld 8-1 by the Rehnquist Court in Morrison. It is axiomatic that a prosecutor does not need to ignore crimes that are discovered in the course of a valid investigation. And of course, Mueller’s subsequent conduct, even if it has been too expansive, would not retroactively invalidate his initial appointment.

The very most that can be said, therefore, is that some of Mueller's indictments might be vulnerable to challenge, but not that his very position violates the Constitution.

Calabresi's reading of the Constitution's text is strained and unprecedented. Moreover, text is not the only source of constitutional meaning.

833.0,"Let us agree that man-made climate change presents a serious challenge to humanity which should be urgently addressed by every government.

Set aside the protestations of the relatively few climate change sceptics who either deny the world is warming significantly or assert that, even if it is, carbon emissions are not responsible.

The non-scientists among us — and even the scientists who know nothing about climate change — would be rash to ignore the consensus among the thousands of experts who have studied the issue. Climate change is taking place.

But that doesn’t mean we should meekly swallow all the latest crystal ball gazing by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This United Nations body has just published some blood-curdling warnings.

The IPCC pronounces that global carbon dioxide emissions must virtually halve within 12 years to avoid a calamitous loss of coral reefs and Arctic ice, as well as intense floods and droughts.

The IPCC pronounces that global carbon dioxide emissions must virtually halve within 12 years to avoid a calamitous loss of coral reefs

Since there isn’t the remotest possibility that these emissions can be halved in so short a period of time — global emissions have been increasing, albeit slightly, though Britain has cut its own by 43 per cent since 1990 — one might be tempted to curl up in bed with a cup of cocoa and wait for Armageddon to arrive.

Except that the IPCC and other supposedly knowledgeable international bodies have produced dire warnings in the past which have not borne fruit. They specialise in making the hairs stand up on the back of our necks.

For example, in 2005 the WWF — formerly the World Wildlife Fund — exceeded even the IPCC’s pessimism at the time, and suggested that all Arctic ice might melt within five years. It’s still there.

In the same year, the United Nations Environmental Programme forecast that within five years some 50 million ‘climate refugees’ would be fleeing large areas of the globe which would have been rendered uninhabitable by the effects of climate change. This hasn’t happened yet.

Previous false predictions did not deter the International Energy Agency from informing us in 2011 that we had five years to start slashing carbon emissions, or give up the game. They weren’t cut, and now the IPPC says we have another 12 years.

I could go on. The point is that numerous expert bodies have forecast an imminent catastrophe, but it hasn’t happened.

And yet these thwarted soothsayers pop up again without any hint of apology for having got things wrong, as usual invoking the unchallengeable authority of science.

Meanwhile, laymen cheerfully jump on the bandwagon of doom. In March 2009, Prince Charles stated that we had ‘only 100 months to act’ before damage caused by climate change became irreversible. Those 100 months have passed, but no one seems to think the damage can’t be undone.

Prince Charles once stated that we had ‘only 100 months to act’ before damage caused by climate change became irreversible

No less hysterically, Gordon Brown proclaimed as Prime Minister in October 2009 that ‘we had 50 days to save the world’.

This was shortly before the Copenhagen summit on climate change. It did not change the world any more than any subsequent conferences on the same subject have done. And yet life still goes on.

Isn’t the lesson of all this that it is a perilous business predicting the future — particularly the short-term future — because one can so quickly be demonstrated to have been up the spout?

The danger, of course, is that if self-appointed clairvoyants produce too many spine-chilling prophecies, sooner or later the general public won’t believe anything they say. That would be a great pity, since climate change is a reality.

Gordon Brown proclaimed as Prime Minister in October 2009 that ‘we had 50 days to save the world’

I imagine the thinking of the IPCC and other similar organisations is that the best way to jolt governments and people into action is to exaggerate like mad. In fact, like all those who are seen as habitually crying wolf, they risk ending up being disbelieved.

What is needed, I submit, is a bit more candour and humility on the part of these presumptuous scientists.

Because they are fallible human beings rather than all-knowing gods, they can’t know for sure the magnitude of the risks that face us. And they shouldn’t pretend to.

This week’s IPCC report judged that global warning must be kept to a maximum of 1.5c warmer than pre-industrial levels, rather than the 2c ceiling previously envisaged. How can scientists be so sure that the lower figure should become the new goal?

I ask because it carries enormous extra costs. The IPCC estimates that new energy infrastructure — wind, solar and electricity storage — as well as technologies that can capture CO2 from the atmosphere, could cost a jaw dropping £1,800 billion.

This will be paid for by the likes of you and me. Indeed, it is already being met in the form of ‘green levies’. In 2015, these were estimated to amount to an extra £112 a year in energy bills. They are sure to go on rising.

And then there other costs, such as those advocated by the Institution of Engineering and Technology, reported in today’s Mail.

It envisages a deep ‘retro-fit’ with solar panels and triple glazing for 25 million homes. The cost would run into tens of billions of pounds, though there would be considerable savings in energy bills.

Shouldn’t there be some acknowledgement that Britain has done more than almost any other country in the world to bring down its carbon emissions?

The Government must not jettison good sense, nor accept the exorbitant shopping list presented by IPCC scientists guilty of over-egging the pudding.

My own patience snapped when I heard one of them saying that we should eat little or, ideally, no meat; drive as little as possible; and avoid travelling by plane. This same person had just flown to the IPCC conference in South Korea with hundreds of colleagues, generating a sizeable amount of carbon dioxide.

Any such small measures we might take pale into irrelevance when one considers the sins of the world’s major producer of carbon, China — which accounts for more than a quarter of global carbon dioxide output.

A Greenpeace analysis based on Beijing’s own data suggests that China’s carbon emissions are soaring at their fastest rate for years. According to a recent analysis of satellite imagery, hundreds of Chinese coal-fired power stations are under development.

Al Gore - who warned of global warming dangers - is accused using more electricity in his mansion in a month than the average US house does in one year

Show me a climate change fanatic, and I can often show you a hypocrite.

Former vice-president Al Gore, whose powerful film warned of the terrible dangers of global warming, stands accused of consuming more electricity in his magnificent mansion in a month than an average U.S. household uses in a year.

That climate change zealot Prince Charles thinks nothing of jumping on a plane of the Royal Flight.

Weeks after telling us that we had 50 days to save the world, Gordon Brown chartered a 185-seat Airbus to take him and 20 aides to the climate change summit in Copenhagen.

The truth is that many extreme proponents of man-made climate change, whether scientists or public figures, are not always as transparent about their own carbon footprints as they are censorious of other people’s.

More of us would respect exhortations to cut out beef, and mothball the family car and go by train instead of plane, if we could be sure that those who love to lecture us were prepared to make sacrifices of their own.

And I also suggest that the public would respond more favourably to warnings about climate change if they were balanced and measured, and avoided sensational and unprovable claims.

835.0,"Samuel Johnson once said, “When a man knows he is to be hanged ... it concentrates his mind wonderfully.” For opponents of the Trump immigration order, minds became distinctly more concentrated around 11am this morning, when the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated much of Trump’s order in a reversal of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. While the court will hear the merits in October and could still rule against the administration, these preliminary decisions often reflect a view of underlying merits.

For those of us who have long argued that the legal authority supported Trump, the order was belated but not surprising. However, the order does offer a brief respite for some self-examination for both legal commentators, and frankly, the courts. At times the analysis surrounding the immigration order seemed to drop any pretense of objectivity and took on the character of open Trump bashing.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Supreme Court ruled the administration could enforce its immigration order under Section 2(c), which deals with the suspension of entry from six countries. The court ordered that the vetting could commence with the exception of “foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.”

The court ruled “when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the United States, for the reasons we have set out, the balance tips in favor of the Government’s compelling need to provide for the Nation’s security.” The preliminary ruling on this type of stay indicates that, when the final merits are decided, a majority of the court is likely to make the changes permanent and binding.

Indeed, three justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch — did not want any limitation on lifting the injunction and dissented from that part of the opinion. To use Johnson’s rhetoric, the date of the hanging is set for the October term absent a dramatic shift on the court. That gives us some time to contemplate how this controversy has impacted our core institutions.

I previously wrote that Trump seems at times to bring out the worst of people — supporters and opponents alike. Yet, his signature attacks often cause people to fulfill the very stereotypes that he paints, particularly among some reporters and judges. Ironically, Trump’s attacks on the media as biased may not have been true at the outset but they are true now. Mainstream media have become openly hostile to Trump.

There is often little distinction on some cable networks between the hosts and their guests in attacking Trump, who brings much of this criticism on himself in ill-considered and often insulting attacks. However, the media is trained to resist such personal emotions and retain objectivity. Throughout much of its history, it has done precisely that ... until Donald Trump.

He seems like the itch that reporters and commentators just have to scratch and frankly sometimes it seems like a few are enjoying it too much. With ratings soaring, hosts and legal experts have shown little interest or patience in the legal arguments supporting his case, even though the Obama administration advanced similar arguments in court.

The hostile (and often distorted) analysis in the media was disconcerting but predictable, given the trend toward greater opinion-infused coverage. Networks are fighting for greater audience shares based on formulaic coverage — offering echo-chamber analysis to fit the ideological preferences of viewers. For the anti-Trump networks, the legal analysis is tellingly parallel with the political analysis. These cable shows offer clarity to viewers in a world without nuance. The law, however, often draws subtle distinctions and balancing tests. In this way, viewers are being given a false notion of the underlying legal issues in these controversies.

What has been more concerning is the impact of Trump on the courts. Trump shocked many in both parties by his personal attacks on judges as well as general disrespect shown to our courts. These were highly inappropriate and inaccurate statements from a president. However, once again, courts seemed to immediately become the very stereotype that Trump was painting.

Of course, the White House gave the courts a target-rich environment in the first travel order, which was poorly drafted, poorly executed and poorly defended. Yet, the courts did not just strike those portions that were problematic. Where existing case law requires courts to use a scalpel in striking down provisions, judges pulled out a meat ax. They enjoined the entirety of the order while lashing out at Trump’s most sensational campaign rhetoric.

In the second round, the judicial decisions became even more problematic. The Trump administration brought in capable people who drafted the order correctly and defended it well. It addressed glaring errors in the original order like not exempting green card holders. It did not make a difference. The trial court in Hawaii even denied the ability of the administration to study and work on improving vetting procedures in the high-risk countries (part of the order later reversed in the Ninth Circuit).

In the Fourth and Ninth Circuits, judges brushed over the obvious improvements and again relied on Trump’s own comments and tweets. It seemed like sensational tweets were more important than long-standing precedent or official statements from the administration.

The level of reliance on campaign statements by the courts was wrong in my view, as I have repeatedly stated. The record had conflicting statements from Trump and his associates but courts seemed to cherry-pick statements, relying on those that fulfilled their narrative while ignoring those that did not. The analysis of the order should have turned largely on the face of the document. While such political statements can be relevant to analysis (particularly in areas like racial discrimination), the court has always minimized such reliance in favor of more objective textual analysis.

A long line of cases following the decision in Kleindienst v. Mandel followed this approach. In that case, the court rejected such inquiries over the denial of a visa to a Belgian Marxist journalist. It stated that “when the Executive exercises [its] power negatively on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason, the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against the First Amendment interests of those who seek personal communication with the applicant.”

The Supreme Court’s decision is consistent with this long-standing precedent. In fairness to the courts and some commentators, there are good-faith reasons to argue against the travel order. Indeed, I predicted at the outset that there would be conflicting decisions in the courts. However, it was the tenor and basis for the decisions that I found disturbing. Courts that once gave President Obama sweeping discretion in the immigration field seemed categorically opposed to considering the same accommodation for President Trump Donald John TrumpFive takeaways from the Democratic National Convention What we'll remember from the 2020 Biden convention Chris Wallace labels Biden's acceptance speech 'enormously effective' MORE. For commentators, viewers were given a highly distorted view of the existing law — brushing aside decades of cases while supporting the notion that a major federal policy could live or die by the tweet.

The Supreme Court’s stay should cause an examination of more than the lower court decisions. It should concentrate minds in both the courts and the media on the loss of objectivity in analysis over the “immigration ban.” There seemed an inability to separate the policy from the personality in this controversy. That is a serious problem for both institutions. Injunctions come and go. Yet, integrity and objectivity are things that, once lost, are hard to regain.

The level of reliance on campaign statements by the courts was wrong in my view, as I have repeatedly stated. The record had conflicting statements from Trump and his associates but courts seemed to cherry-pick statements, relying on those that fulfilled their narrative while ignoring those that did not. The analysis of the order should have turned largely on the face of the document. While such political statements can be relevant to analysis (particularly in areas like racial discrimination), the court has always minimized such reliance in favor of more objective textual analysis.

A long line of cases following the decision in Kleindienst v. Mandel followed this approach. In that case, the court rejected such inquiries over the denial of a visa to a Belgian Marxist journalist. It stated that “when the Executive exercises [its] power negatively on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason, the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against the First Amendment interests of those who seek personal communication with the applicant.”

The Supreme Court’s decision is consistent with this long-standing precedent. In fairness to the courts and some commentators, there are good-faith reasons to argue against the travel order. Indeed, I predicted at the outset that there would be conflicting decisions in the courts. However, it was the tenor and basis for the decisions that I found disturbing. Courts that once gave President Obama sweeping discretion in the immigration field seemed categorically opposed to considering the same accommodation for President Trump Donald John TrumpFive takeaways from the Democratic National Convention What we'll remember from the 2020 Biden convention Chris Wallace labels Biden's acceptance speech 'enormously effective' MORE. For commentators, viewers were given a highly distorted view of the existing law — brushing aside decades of cases while supporting the notion that a major federal policy could live or die by the tweet.

The Supreme Court’s stay should cause an examination of more than the lower court decisions. It should concentrate minds in both the courts and the media on the loss of objectivity in analysis over the “immigration ban.” There seemed an inability to separate the policy from the personality in this controversy. That is a serious problem for both institutions. Injunctions come and go. Yet, integrity and objectivity are things that, once lost, are hard to regain.

887.0,"The Time magazine Person of the Year cover looks very good. The image, whether spotted on newsstands or shared and retweeted across timelines, is an arresting one that will make you stop and stare. You’ll pick up the magazine or click on the link, only to find that this victory—ostensibly a blow to Donald Trump—isn’t as strong as it seems.

Past the badass black velvet and the optics of inclusion, “The Silence Breakers” is more than a little problematic. Once the empowering imagery of a group of strong women snatching this honor out of the President’s tiny hands fades, we’re left to contend with the group of people who were chosen to represent a movement—women like actress Ashley Judd, strawberry picker Isabel Pascual, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, and pop singer Taylor Swift. In evoking a seismic sexual harassment reckoning, Time’s cover story attempts to illustrate how issues of workplace harassment and sexual assault affect women (and men) across race and class demographics. Additionally, it emphasizes that many women who make up this movement are nameless and faceless, under-recognized activists in a struggle that has been disproportionally attributed to famous, affluent white women.

But featuring a wide array of voices doesn’t make up for the fact that a few of these names feel like they were chosen by an SEO generator. The most jarring face on this cover is, of course, Taylor Swift’s. Swift technically fits the bill as a woman who took her groper to court this year. But Time’s decision to laud her as a “silence breaker” is ironic on multiple counts, and suggests that the magazine was willing to barter some integrity for star power and social media buzz. In her interview for Time, her first since the trial, Swift explains why she decided to pursue legal action against the Colorado radio DJ whom she says grabbed her butt during a photo opportunity (technically, that DJ sued Swift for defamation, and she countersued).

According to Swift, who won the case along with a symbolic dollar bill, “I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances and high stakes, imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance.” She continued, “I think that this moment is important for awareness, for how parents are talking to their children, and how victims are processing their trauma, whether it be new or old. The brave women and men who have come forward this year have all moved the needle in terms of letting people know that this abuse of power shouldn’t be tolerated…Even though awareness is higher than ever about workplace sexual harassment, there are still so many people who feel victimized, afraid and silenced by their abusers and circumstances.”

Swift, who has struggled with her public image in the past, comes across quite well in this interview. She jokes with the Time reporter that her stint on the stand “was the most amount of times the word ‘ass’ has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.” She offers strong words of support for survivors and against victim blaming. Time even goes so far as to proclaim, “Her clear-eyed testimony marked one of several major milestones in the conversation around sexual harassment this year”—a claim few have ever heard before.

Still, whether or not Swift’s story actually helped jumpstart a movement isn’t what makes her under-qualified or even ineligible for this honor. Because while the singer’s story certainly fits the general description of a woman standing up to harassment, her entire public persona is completely at odds with the notion of a “silence breaker.”

Let’s put Swift’s Time puff piece in perspective. Women like Ashley Judd, one of the first women to come forward against Harvey Weinstein on the record, have had silence imposed upon them. When these women do decide to speak out, they risk mammoth personal and professional repercussions. Meanwhile, Swift consistently offers strongly worded statements only when she has something to gain from them. In this interview alone, it is striking to witness the specificity of Swift’s responses when discussing a movement that’s inextricably tied to politics in the Trump era. Swift is given a platform to show off her “good” opinions, but isn’t questioned on her decision to neither endorse Hillary Clinton nor denounce Donald Trump during the 2016 election.

“ Time’s “silence breaker” of the year has threatened legal action against a blogger for exploring the ties between Taylor Swift and her adoring Daily Stormer fan base. ”

While other celebrities, particularly those who advocate on behalf of women and girls, have routinely called out the accused rapist who is currently our Commander-in-Chief, Swift has failed to extend her survivor solidarity to Trump’s alleged victims. As The Daily Beast has pointed out before, Swift’s inability to criticize the Republican presidential candidate probably had something to do with her fan base. Swift isn’t just an entertainer who won’t take a stand against Donald Trump—she’s a woman who won’t even denounce her own neo-Nazi fans. In fact, Time’s “silence breaker” of the year has threatened legal action against a blogger for exploring the ties between Taylor Swift and her adoring Daily Stormer fan base.

When she’s not trying to literally silence the press, Swift speaks out in a way that is at odds with the intersectional feminist approach at the heart of Time’s latest endeavor. Swift is the beneficiary of a system that privileges whiteness, and she appears to have no moral qualms reaping the rewards of racist stereotypes. While the pop singer has repeatedly resorted to playing the victim, her routine reached problematic peaks in 2016. After Kanye West shouted the singer out in his song “Famous,” Swift proceeded to publicly demonize the rapper in an infamous Grammys acceptance speech.

“I wanna say to all the young women out there: there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success, or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame,” she said, not-so-subtly referencing the West track. Kim Kardashian subsequently showed that Kanye had in fact reached out to Swift for her blessings on the raunchy lyrics, and accused Swift of manipulating the situation to her advantage. “She totally knew that that was coming out,” Kardashian insisted. “She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn't.”

While Swift contested the Wests’ version of events, the fact remains that Swift chose to publicly shame West, in a rhetorical feat that continued their epic feud and positioned her as the sexually objectified victim of an angry black man. Whether or not she understood the full implications, Swift played into a historically potent, harmful trope, and would have retained the public’s sympathy if not for Kardashian’s cunning social media coup.

Swift’s bravery in showing up to court to confront the man who groped her isn’t up for question. But to call Swift a feminist “silence breaker” is a bold erasure of every time she’s failed to show up or speak out for women in the past. Swift, who was initially reticent to call herself a feminist, has embraced “girl power” rhetoric without all of the pesky politics. Instead of, say, actively protesting in solidarity with women everywhere in the wake of Donald Trump’s election, Swift … tweeted. “So much love, pride, and respect for those who marched” she wrote during the Women’s March. “I’m proud to be a woman today, and every day.”

Because of her spineless feminism and political passivity, Taylor Swift is hardly the figure of female empowerment that Time is making her out to be. In fact, a recent meme has highlighted just how uninspired the internet is by Taylor Swift. After a fan shared an image of Swift and dared Twitter to “name a bitch badder” than TayTay, the world wide web clapped back with lists of women who have actually put their lives on the line, surmounting enormous odds in order to make a difference or achieve greatness. Answers ranged from Zheng Shi, a sex worker in Canton who was captured by a pirate and ultimately commanded a fleet of over 300 ships, to literally any of these women of color.

935.0,"Almost exactly a year ago, a widely shared article in the New York Daily News alerted the world that Richard Simmons — the beloved ‘80s fitness guru whose peppy enthusiasm and flamboyance became forever associated with the decade — had not been seen in public since February 2014. The article, citing a close friend of Simmons, raised the disconcerting possibility that Simmons was somehow being held captive against his will or was being coerced to remain in his own house by a manipulative housekeeper.

Then, last month, a new podcast called Missing Richard Simmons began digging into the “mystery” of Simmons’s sudden reclusion. The podcast’s host, Dan Taberski, is a former Daily Show producer who took group fitness classes with Simmons at the exercise guru’s Los Angeles fitness studio Slimmons in 2012. (The studio closed last fall.) Citing their personal connection and public interest, Taberski has used the podcast to try to figure out what happened to Simmons, mainly by interviewing people once close to him.

“Richard Simmons completely and inexplicably stopped being Richard Simmons, and I want to find out why,” Taberski states in the first of what will be six episodes. The final episode was released Monday, and the answer to Taberski’s quest proved to be as open-ended as everything else about the “mystery.”

Missing Richard Simmons quickly generated buzz and media attention, with its first four episodes ranking No. 1 in their release weeks on the iTunes podcast chart as Serial fans and lovers of true crime and other mystery podcasts flocked to the project.

But as Taberski’s attempts to get close to Simmons ramped up, so did serious discussions about what right the public has to intrude on Simmons’s life. During its six-week run, the podcast generated increasing controversy as listeners and the media questioned whether Taberski’s brand of investigative journalism consisted of anything more than badgering people and stalking a man who clearly wanted to be left alone. By the end, everyone from the Los Angeles police to Simmons’s manager to many members of the media had challenged Taberski’s mission.

Although Taberski stated amid the backlash that he planned to finish his reporting for Missing Richard Simmons’s final episode, he confessed in said episode that much of what he wanted to include, in particular a confrontation with Simmons’s housekeeper, “got the boot.” (He doesn’t explain why.) The podcast ultimately concluded with Taberski interviewing Simmons’s manager, Michael Catalano.

Catalano, who had criticized the podcast to Entertainment Tonight, told Taberski in the episode that he believed the project has generated “more worry and speculation” than answers. And ultimately, Missing Richard Simmons came to say more about public interaction with celebrity culture — and the question of whether Taberski, or any of us, has a right to know why a public figure seeks privacy and solitude — than about Simmons himself.

The “mystery” of Simmons’s welfare was solved before the podcast debuted

Just a few weeks ago, on March 9, the LAPD notified People magazine that police had conducted welfare checks on Simmons at his home at least twice since January 2015. The police reported that Simmons is “perfectly fine” and “very happy” and that any rumors about staff holding him hostage were “garbage.”

In fact, Simmons himself had confirmed his welfare a year ago. In March of 2016, the day after the New York Daily News’s story ran, Simmons told Entertainment Tonight that ""No one should be worried about me. The people that surround me are wonderful people who take great care of me.""

And the day after that, he called into the Today show to dispel the rumors, stating, “I just sort of wanted to be a little bit of a loner for a while.”

""No one is holding me in my house as a hostage."" -Richard Simmons refutes recent reports in interview w/Savannah https://t.co/hkksIrz315 — TODAY (@TODAYshow) March 14, 2016

This information didn’t seem to make a difference to Taberski.

In response to the LAPD’s March 9 statement, Taberski told the Ringer in an interview that he thought the police report was “fantastic” but that he was still “actively reporting” his podcast’s then-remaining episodes.

“[If Simmons] asked me to stop the podcast, would I? No,” he told the Guardian.

But if Simmons is fine, what was there to report?

Plenty, fans of the podcast might argue.

Serial taught us to love an introspective podcast journey exploring multiple points of view — but are all journeys worth taking?

In addition to pushing podcasts into the mainstream as a storytelling medium, 2014’s Serial, which took the public by storm and won a Peabody Award for its enigmatic first season, made a certain kind of podcast very trendy. Host Sarah Koenig’s introspection and first-person participation in the stories she tells on the series have since become a standard feature of many documentary and journalistic podcasts.

But since Taberski couldn’t get beyond the fence separating Simmons’s faux antebellum Los Angeles home from the rest of the world — he tried and failed several times to reach Simmons physically, by visiting his house, as well as through less intrusive means — his narrative journey mainly consisted of interviewing a mix of people who’ve interacted with Simmons at some point in the past. The closeness that Taberski’s sources have shared with Simmons varies greatly, from close friends to people who worked out with him at Slimmons, to acquaintances who spoke to Simmons shortly before his withdrawal from public life.

Throughout Missing Richard Simmons’s six episodes, the host considers quite a range of reasons for why Simmons might have isolated himself. This journey takes Taberski from wondering if Simmons is depressed, to spreading and then dismissing a rumor that he’s undergoing a gender transition, to speculating that he’s been ensorcelled by a witchcraft-practicing housemaid. This approach — identify all possible options, then investigate each one each one in hopes of reaching a definitive end — falls squarely within the emphasis on multiplicity that podcasts like Serial and This American Life have laid the groundwork for; the idea is that getting to an ultimate right answer isn’t the goal so much as exploring different points of view around a theme.

But Taberski, as many curious mystery fans have done before him, finds cause to reject what appears to be the right answer: the one provided a year ago by Simmons himself. Taberski continually returns to the idea that no possible reason can explain Simmons’s seclusion or extended silence. For instance, when speculating in episode two that Simmons is recuperating from a knee injury, Taberski asks, “Why not just say that?”

Taberski does confront the idea that Simmons doesn’t owe anyone, least of all Taberski, an explanation for his behavior — but he does it primarily through his interview subjects.

“He’s allowed to go away,” former RuPaul’s Drag Race contestant Willam Belli tells Taberski in episode two. “He wants to go away, he wants to live his Marlene Dietrich fantasy, ‘I want to be alone’? — goodbye, girl.”

What Taberski calls a “loving” search for the “truth” can also be read as an aggressive inability to respect Simmons’s privacy

In response to those who’ve called for Taberski to simply leave Simmons alone, Taberski has argued that Simmons has meant too much to too many people to be allowed remove himself from the public eye. Speaking, in episode two, about the aggressively upbeat public persona that Simmons maintained for years, he states, “I think when someone like that stops being that person, it’s worth asking why.”

But Missing Richard Simmons doesn’t just ask why. “There are drag queens and stakeouts,” Taberski states in episode one as he teasers listeners with hints of what’s to come. “Restraining orders are filed.” In episode two, titled “Stakeout,” Taberski really does essentially take the listener on a stakeout of Simmons’s house, scoping out the place with a friend and then walking up to the gates only to realize there’s no buzzer or doorbell to contact whoever’s inside. He confesses to “badgering” one source into talking to him over a period of more than a year. (Taberski had been planning to make a documentary on Simmons before Simmons’s reclusion, and eventually changed his plans accordingly.)

Taberski has drawn sharp criticism for his handling of sensitive issues regarding Simmons’s privacy, particularly his speculation regarding Simmons’s gender, sexuality, and mental health. In episode three, he says he’s not going to publicly speculate on Simmons’s sexuality; then he immediately seems to out Simmons by claiming that he once went on a double date with Simmons, who was out with a man. As the New York Times noted when calling Missing Richard Simmons a “morally suspect” podcast, this is also how Taberski approaches Simmons’s gender identity:

Mr. Taberski digs into a tabloid report that Mr. Simmons is transitioning to female. He takes a moment to note that Mr. Simmons’s gender identity is nobody’s business but his own, then forges right ahead … A serious journalistic transgression — outing a person — is played here as just another sensational twist to be picked apart for podcast fodder.

Taberski consistently frames these intrusions as compassionate concern — “a grand gesture” he hopes will be “too big to ignore.” In episode five, he addresses Simmons directly, asking him to talk to the podcast so that Simmons’s fans, Taberski included, can support and comfort him. “Let us be the empathetic ones for a change,” he says. Taberski then goes on to promise that in the podcast’s final episode he will be “loving but persistent” — before spending the final episode backtracking, corroborating the LAPD’s report that Simmons is fine, and turning his inquiry on himself:

“If [Simmons] is fine, what does that make me?”

Yet, even with his mission statement finally undermined, Taberski doesn’t attempt to seriously answer this question in the podcast’s final moments. Even when Catalano tells him that Missing Richard Simmons may have made life worse, not better, for Richard Simmons himself, Taberski dodges and changes subjects. Instead, he muses on what it means that Simmons might truly be just fine, inserting himself into Simmons’s headspace and point of view as though he’s suddenly satisfied with his (lack of) findings.

All told, rather than plumb an actual mystery, Missing Richard Simmons has served to illustrate the often aggressive entitlement that people can feel over the private lives of celebrities. Taberski seems far less interested in what Simmons actually wants for himself and more interested in undermining Simmons’s agency over his own life, both by invading his privacy on a number of fronts and by rejecting his own stated explanation for his withdrawal from public.

And while Taberski appeared to genuinely want his podcast to be an expression of love and empathy, it’s evident that his investigative experiment had a dark side.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

This approach — identify all possible options, then investigate each one each one in hopes of reaching a definitive end — falls squarely within the emphasis on multiplicity that podcasts like Serial and This American Life have laid the groundwork for; the idea is that getting to an ultimate right answer isn’t the goal so much as exploring different points of view around a theme.

But Taberski, as many curious mystery fans have done before him, finds cause to reject what appears to be the right answer: the one provided a year ago by Simmons himself. Taberski continually returns to the idea that no possible reason can explain Simmons’s seclusion or extended silence. For instance, when speculating in episode two that Simmons is recuperating from a knee injury, Taberski asks, “Why not just say that?”

Taberski does confront the idea that Simmons doesn’t owe anyone, least of all Taberski, an explanation for his behavior — but he does it primarily through his interview subjects.

“He’s allowed to go away,” former RuPaul’s Drag Race contestant Willam Belli tells Taberski in episode two. “He wants to go away, he wants to live his Marlene Dietrich fantasy, ‘I want to be alone’? — goodbye, girl.”

What Taberski calls a “loving” search for the “truth” can also be read as an aggressive inability to respect Simmons’s privacy

In response to those who’ve called for Taberski to simply leave Simmons alone, Taberski has argued that Simmons has meant too much to too many people to be allowed remove himself from the public eye. Speaking, in episode two, about the aggressively upbeat public persona that Simmons maintained for years, he states, “I think when someone like that stops being that person, it’s worth asking why.”

But Missing Richard Simmons doesn’t just ask why. “There are drag queens and stakeouts,” Taberski states in episode one as he teasers listeners with hints of what’s to come. “Restraining orders are filed.” In episode two, titled “Stakeout,” Taberski really does essentially take the listener on a stakeout of Simmons’s house, scoping out the place with a friend and then walking up to the gates only to realize there’s no buzzer or doorbell to contact whoever’s inside. He confesses to “badgering” one source into talking to him over a period of more than a year. (Taberski had been planning to make a documentary on Simmons before Simmons’s reclusion, and eventually changed his plans accordingly.)

Taberski has drawn sharp criticism for his handling of sensitive issues regarding Simmons’s privacy, particularly his speculation regarding Simmons’s gender, sexuality, and mental health. In episode three, he says he’s not going to publicly speculate on Simmons’s sexuality; then he immediately seems to out Simmons by claiming that he once went on a double date with Simmons, who was out with a man. As the New York Times noted when calling Missing Richard Simmons a “morally suspect” podcast, this is also how Taberski approaches Simmons’s gender identity:

Mr. Taberski digs into a tabloid report that Mr. Simmons is transitioning to female. He takes a moment to note that Mr. Simmons’s gender identity is nobody’s business but his own, then forges right ahead … A serious journalistic transgression — outing a person — is played here as just another sensational twist to be picked apart for podcast fodder.

Taberski consistently frames these intrusions as compassionate concern — “a grand gesture” he hopes will be “too big to ignore.” In episode five, he addresses Simmons directly, asking him to talk to the podcast so that Simmons’s fans, Taberski included, can support and comfort him. “Let us be the empathetic ones for a change,” he says. Taberski then goes on to promise that in the podcast’s final episode he will be “loving but persistent” — before spending the final episode backtracking, corroborating the LAPD’s report that Simmons is fine, and turning his inquiry on himself:

“If [Simmons] is fine, what does that make me?”

Yet, even with his mission statement finally undermined, Taberski doesn’t attempt to seriously answer this question in the podcast’s final moments. Even when Catalano tells him that Missing Richard Simmons may have made life worse, not better, for Richard Simmons himself, Taberski dodges and changes subjects. Instead, he muses on what it means that Simmons might truly be just fine, inserting himself into Simmons’s headspace and point of view as though he’s suddenly satisfied with his (lack of) findings.

All told, rather than plumb an actual mystery, Missing Richard Simmons has served to illustrate the often aggressive entitlement that people can feel over the private lives of celebrities. Taberski seems far less interested in what Simmons actually wants for himself and more interested in undermining Simmons’s agency over his own life, both by invading his privacy on a number of fronts and by rejecting his own stated explanation for his withdrawal from public.

And while Taberski appeared to genuinely want his podcast to be an expression of love and empathy, it’s evident that his investigative experiment had a dark side.

972.0,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

The contrast could not have been starker. One picture showed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi smiling as she signed (with numerous pens) two articles of impeachment against President Trump. She passed out the pens like souvenirs to fellow Democrats. They were embossed in gold with her signature and rested on silver trays.

The other picture was of President Trump signing phase one of a new trade deal with China.

Which picture depicted events of greater long-term benefit to Americans? Unless you are a rank partisan out to remove President Trump from office by whatever means, the obvious answer is the China trade deal.

The latest wrench thrown into the machinery of government comes from Democrats who released to their compliant media friends a “note to self” written on a hotel notepad supposedly by Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney and a frequent flyer to Ukraine. The note said, “Get (Ukrainian president) Zalensky to announce that the Biden case will be investigated.”

Democrats claim Mr. Parnas was an intermediary in the effort to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

Mr. Parnas’ credibility would be in doubt were he under oath before a court, instead of “testifying” on various cable TV programs. Mr. Parnas heads a company that claims to combat fraud. Oh, the irony.

Democrats insist the Senate trial be “fair.” How is it fair when House Democrats continue to leak documents they hope will damage the president and influence senators to vote for his removal from office? Some Democratic senators, who will sit in judgment of the president, have already declared him guilty.

It is politics at its worst and opens the door, as some of the Founders warned, for “normalizing” impeachment.

Historical background is always helpful and so I consulted the National Constitution Center, a private, nonprofit organization and a leading platform for constitutional education and debate, where I found this:

The “high crimes and misdemeanors” language in the U.S. Constitution remains controversial today. In two essays … Neil J. Kinkopf and Keith E. Whittington looked at the Founder’s vision: “The Framers meant for the phrase ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ to signify only conduct that seriously harms the public and seriously compromises the officer’s ability to continue. If the phrase is given a less rigorous interpretation, it could allow Congress to influence and control the President and the courts …”

The article continues: “When the Founders wanted to ensure accountability, they mostly relied on elections and the voters to hold government officials responsible for their actions,” said Mr. Whittington. “But what might fall into the category of ‘other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’ was still quite unclear.”

Mr. Trump’s call to Ukraine’s president, which is at the heart of the impeachment articles, does not meet the standard of seriously harming the public or compromising the president’s ability to do his job as shown by the China trade deal and the trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada, both signed and passed days after impeachment.

That the Government Accountability Office says the president “broke the law” by withholding $250 million in military aid to Ukraine, aid Congress had approved, doesn’t help the president’s defenders, but does it rise to the level of a “high crime and misdemeanor?” Senators will decide. But they should recall that in 2014 the GAO ruled President Obama’s prisoner deal to exchange Guantanamo Bay detainees for deserter Bowe Bergdahl violated federal law. Mr. Obama was not impeached.

Mrs. Pelosi summed up the true motives of Democrats when she said that regardless of what the Senate does, impeachment will be a “permanent stain” on President Trump’s legacy.

In fact, the stain will be on Democrats. It is Democrats who have plotted ways to reverse the will of voters who elected Mr. Trump. It is Democrats who fear he will be overwhelmingly re-elected in November.

Top o’ the mawnin’ Mobsters. Let’s start with an opinion bound to hiss off a few of us gathered here today.

Wednesday night, Todd Frazier rocketed a line drive foul into the stands at Yankee Stadium. The ball hit a small girl in the face. She was sitting with her grandparents in the 5th row, third base side. She was taken to the hospital. Apparently, she will be fine.

Terrible, obviously. Potentially tragic. Preventable.

It will re-ignite the debate about protective netting at baseball parks.

Most clubs don’t have it, including the Reds.

Should they?

Knee-jerk says, of course, they should. No fan should have to worry about safety at a game. I agree with that. Also, this:

At some point, fans need to take responsibility for their own well-being. Maybe that means having the common sense not to put a small child in harm’s way of a foul ball at a baseball game.

Are 5th-row seats for the enjoyment of the child? Or for the enjoyment of you? If I’m taking a 3-year-old to a ballgame, we’re sitting upstairs.

Insensitive? Perhaps. But it’s not MLB’s doing when fans choose to sit where a batted ball could constitute a physical threat. So many laws we have now are at least partly the result of people failing to take personal responsibility. I don’t want more laws telling me what to do. (Government as nanny.) And I really don’t want to blame others for what is at least partly my doing.

Yeah?

AP:

Twins second baseman Brian Dozier offered his impressions.

""Either, one, you don't bring kids down there, or No. 2, every stadium needs to have nets,"" Dozier said. ""That's it. I don't care about the damn view of a fan or what. It's all about safety.

""I still have a knot in my stomach ... I hope the kid's OK. We need nets, or don't put kids down there.""

Either that, or if you decide to take kids into foul-ball danger, understand that going in, and accept the consequences.

Lemme have it.

MLEWIS SAID WHAT I SAID a few days ago. Now, it’s on the players. You got a coach fired, or at least helped. No excuses now. What has been underreported this week, in the barrage of anti-Zampese rhetoric, is the distinct possibility the players didn’t give the Ravens and Texans enough respect. We simply cannot lay the entire two-game egg-laying on one guy calling plays.

If the Bengals are as good as they think they are, they’ll start playing like it. No time like the present.

And once again Wednesday, stand-up guy AJ McCarron was at his locker during open locker-room time, willing to talk to any media member who happened by. Man, I want this guy to have his chance.

UH-OH. . . A few players want an Activist Month in the NF of L. The league is active primarily in image-honing and money-printing. It won’t like this, not at all. AP:

A group of four players sent the NFL a memo in August requesting league support and asking for a month to be dedicated to social activism, not long after commissioner Roger Goodell reportedly had talked to several players regarding their game-day activism efforts.

According to Yahoo! Sports, defensive end Michael Bennett of the Seattle Seahawks, Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins and receiver Torrey Smith, and former Arizona Cardinals wideout Anquan Boldin co-authored the 2,740-word document intended to push the NFL into efforts ""similarly to what the league already implements for breast cancer awareness, honoring military, etc.""

""For us, support means: bear all or part of the weight of; hold up; give assistance to, especially financially; enable to function or act. We need support, collaboration and partnerships to achieve our goal of strengthening the community,"" the letter stated.

I don’t know exactly what that means, but I’m sure those behind it do.

I think it’s a slippery slope when a sports league advocates social causes. “Why theirs and not ours?’’ is a natural reaction. So is, “Just entertain me.’’

The NFL has aligned itself with safe, mainstream causes. Who could be against breast cancer research? But fallout SK (Since Kaepernick) might indicate fans have a limit to which they want their entertainment connected to real-world issues. Just like some of youse don’t like it when I write about Trump.

I do like anything that makes the NFL squirm, though. This certainly qualifies.

AND SO, HERE I GO AGAIN. . . Is there a constructive point made in referring to the unstable Kim Jong Un as “Rocket Man’’? Do we really need to goad this guy?

ANOTHER L FROM ANOTHER 2018 NON-FACTOR. This is why September baseball results can be illusory. Rookie Davis got rocked and took the loss last night. If Davis is important to next year’s club, next year’s club will resemble this year’s club.

Bad teams are holding open tryouts. My former team used Tyler Glasnow in relief last night. Tyler Glasnow is the most overrated pitching prospect in the game, the shining-est of examples of why “prospect’’ can be a meaningless label. Having “great prospects’’ can be like having a Ferrari for which you can’t afford gasoline.

Glasnow went 1.1 innings and walked four guys and damned near lost the game. He has started 13 games this year, and been terrible in 12 of them. All the prospect experts have said for two years that Glasgow is can’t-miss. I know I won’t miss him starting in 2018, when I’m over my erstwhile PWS.

A bit feisty this AM, Doc.

Yeah, bad-hair, wrong-side-of-bed happenings, you know?

A REASON I’M GLAD I’M OLD. A story from Awful Announcing, about relative kids abandoning sports journalism. There has never been more opportunity in sports hack-dom to get published and make almost no money in doing so. If I were 29 and not 59, I’d be going to law school right about now.

I BETCHA IF ZEKE ELLIOTT played in Cincinnati nobody would have cared he took a play off in the 3rd quarter of a blowout. Probably because no one outside of Cincinnati would have known.

Being a big-time rookie in Dallas is one of the hardest jobs in sports. Having worked there, I can tell you there is Cowboys football, and there is everything else. Elliott isn’t the most mature of guys, even by NFL standards. Fame, fortune and free time are the three evils of being a young star in the entertainment world. And oh, yeah, women.

It might seem cool to be a rising star Cowboy in Big D. Then it actually happens, and it’s not cool at all.

Other than that, Who TF should care about whether the guy loafed for one play?

Typical NFL melodrama over-drive.

AND NOW, JUST BECAUSE I’M BITCHY DOESN’T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE. FOR YOUR GUZZLING PLEASURE, BEERMANDAVE:

Oktoberfest!

Zinzinnati knows how to party. Oktoberfest was as always a fantastic time. There were plenty of solid Marzen Oktoberfest and German Lagers available, and I hope you had a chance to sample the local Rhinegeist or Braxton options.

Warsteiner and Weihenstephaner always taste better this time of year. You truly had no excuse for not attending. The weather was perfect, and there were dozens of non-Oktoberfest options for those who prefer different styles of beer. I wonder how much Pacifico they sold this weekend?

If you are anything like me, you haven't had your fill of German-style beers. There are some truly exceptional and unique German beers that you may want to check out as we slowly creep into fall. Spaten Optimator is a delicious Doppelbock. Schlenkerla is a Bamberg, Germany based microbrewery, and they make some very interesting Marzen style beers that have a deep smoky flavor.

This almost reminds you of drinking an Oktoberfest with a peaty scotch at the same time. The Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier is the original Marzen with a balanced smoky profile. If you really want to challenge your taste buds, step up to the Urbock version, which is intensely smoky. At 5.1% and 6.5% ABV, these are both easy to drink with a great mouth feel, assuming you like the taste of Peat or roaring campfire in your beer. Looking forward to sampling many more new German style beers over the next few months. Cheers! cincybeerguydave@gmail.com

I like the German and Czech pilsners, myself. The German darks are too heavy for my taste. Just like German food.

1099.0,"THE powers of pardon bestowed on an American president—modelled on those enjoyed by English monarchs in centuries past—are so sweeping and awful that they impose their own discipline on chief executives, or so Alexander Hamilton predicted in Federalist 74. The responsibility of deciding the fate of a fellow-creature will “naturally inspire scrupulousness and caution,” wrote Hamilton. What is more, a president would so “dread” being accused of misusing those powers in a fit of “weakness or connivance”, that he will use them with the utmost “circumspection.”

For all his brilliance, Hamilton could not foresee the election of a president like Donald Trump, for whom acts of unblushing, explicit, crowd-pleasing connivance are a proof of cleverness. Nor could Hamilton guess that partisan factions would one day so divide the republic that a for-profit propaganda industry would cheer on a president for abandoning both scruples and caution.

But that is where America finds itself today. As evidence, consider Mr Trump’s pardon for Joe Arpaio, the demagogic, conspiracy-peddling, publicity-seeking former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona. Mr Arpaio, an early and vocal supporter of Mr Trump’s anti-immigrant policies and a longtime darling of conservative talk-radio and TV hosts, was finally ejected from office by his own voters in 2016 after being convicted of criminal contempt, for wilfully defying court orders to stop using race and ethnicity as grounds for pulling over local residents, in pursuit of immigrants without legal status. By the time he was defeated, Mr Arpaio, 85, had cost the county tens of millions of dollars in legal bills, including settlements after his department was found guilty of unlawful violence in its jails, in some cases leading to deaths.

A presidential pardon, in the words of Supreme Court justices over the years, is intended as an “act of grace”—a forgiveness of a crime that has been proven, and of guilt that has been accepted by the perpetrator. The underlying idea is that public policy may sometimes make it wise to temper the harsh edges of the rule of law—for instance when insurrectionists need to be persuaded to drop their arms (as when George Washington pardoned tax-hating farmers during the Whiskey Rebellion).

Mr Trump and his cheerleaders have a different explanation for Sheriff Joe’s pardon. The authoritarian showman is being pardoned, the president has signalled, because he did nothing wrong in the eyes of “patriots” who know how police powers should really be used. That is not an act of grace. It is an act of nullification by stealth: the highest office-holder in the land saying that legal checks and balances are so much politically correct nonsense.

Mr Trump winked and nodded at the upcoming pardon in a splenetic, rambling 76-minute speech in Phoenix earlier this week. “I won’t do it tonight because I don’t want to cause any controversy,” he said, after asking the crowd: “Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?”

“I’ll make a prediction: I think he’s going to be just fine,” Mr. Trump told his supporters. In tweets the president called Mr Arpaio an “American patriot” who “kept Arizona safe.”

Not all would agree with that assessment. Lexington travelled to Maricopa County last year and met both Sheriff Joe and Joe Penzone, the no-nonsense former cop who defeated him. Phoenix is a deeply divided city—a place to see the demographic clash that the writer Ron Brownstein has called “the grey versus the brown.” On one side, its sun-baked sprawl is filled with silver-haired white retirees from across the country, many of them intensely conservative. They live alongside young families who are increasingly Hispanic and non-white.

Mr Arpaio, who styled himself “America’s toughest sheriff”, is an authoritarian impresario. He housed county prisoners outdoors in tents, even as temperatures reached 145°F (63°C), made them wear pink underwear and put them in chain gangs, sending them to cut weeds or clean roads in the affluent suburbs where his supporters lived. He recruited a posse of volunteer sheriff’s deputies, who sport police uniforms and roar about in patrol cars. In 2011 Mr Arpaio assigned a five-member “cold-case posse”, financed by conservatives across the country, to investigate whether Barack Obama had faked evidence of his birth in America (the sheriff argued that Mr Obama had indeed faked his birth certificate, making him an early ally of Mr Trump, who used the racially charged “birther” conspiracy to launch his own career in nativist politics).

While lesser rivals acquired more minor military hardware from the Pentagon, Mr Arpaio secured a tank (actually a self-propelled Howitzer). He made the action-film star Steven Seagal a posse member and let him drive that tank through a local man’s garden wall in search of illegal cockfighting (policing animal cruelty was a crowd-pleasing staple of the sheriff’s work). Sheriff Joe’s fans cheered when he ordered immigration sweeps that targeted people who appeared to be non-white or Hispanic. He was an early Trump backer, declaring: “Everything that I believe in, he believes in.”

By the time of the 2016 election Mr Arpaio already faced charges for criminal contempt, after allegedly defying court rulings to stop racial profiling. He had been rebuked for setting private investigators on a judge investigating him. The Pentagon asked for its hardware back after several weapons were lost. Mr Penzone, a veteran Phoenix police sergeant, ran for sheriff as a Democrat on the message that citizens’ money had been squandered and that law enforcement had suffered. He promised to close the “tent city” jail, noting that it was half-empty and cost taxpayers a fortune. That back-to-work message won Mr Penzone 158,000 more votes than Hillary Clinton received in Maricopa County, as he picked up support from Republicans embarrassed by or tired of Mr Arpaio. In other words, those Americans who know Mr Arpaio best had already rejected him by the time Mr Trump swooped in to bestow his blessings on his work.

In his own tweets after his pardon, Mr Arpaio called his conviction “a political witch hunt by holdovers in the Obama justice department.” He included a link to a website seeking donations to pay off his legal fees.

Senator John McCain of Arizona, for one, was unimpressed by suggestions that chest-thumping patriotism, as judged by conservative citizens, trumps the rule of law. “No one is above the law,” declared Mr McCain, a Republican. “The individuals entrusted with the privilege of being sworn law officers should always seek to be beyond reproach in their commitment to fairly enforcing the laws they swore to uphold.”

Mr McCain’s words are stirring but out of date. In Mr Trump’s America, those who make the right crowds roar and stamp their feet need fear no reproach.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

Document: THE powers of pardon bestowed on an American president—modelled on those enjoyed by English monarchs in centuries past—are so sweeping and awful that they impose their own discipline on chief executives, or so Alexander Hamilton predicted in Federalist 74. The responsibility of deciding the fate of a fellow-creature will “naturally inspire scrupulousness and caution,” wrote Hamilton. What is more, a president would so “dread” being accused of misusing those powers in a fit of “weakness or connivance”, that he will use them with the utmost “circumspection.”

For all his brilliance, Hamilton could not foresee the election of a president like Donald Trump, for whom acts of unblushing, explicit, crowd-pleasing connivance are a proof of cleverness. Nor could Hamilton guess that partisan factions would one day so divide the republic that a for-profit propaganda industry would cheer on a president for abandoning both scruples and caution.

1119.0,"Mark Hamill in Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Photo: Lucasfilm)

The latest film in the long-running saga is an unoriginal, tone-deaf mess.

The crowd seemed unusually unsettled at the New York City media screening for Star Wars: The Last Jedi. All evening, people seemed to be wandering up the aisles. Maybe they drank too much soda. Maybe they weren’t mentally prepared for a 152-minute movie. Or maybe they were retreating to the lobby to give themselves a pep talk: It’s not as bad as the prequels. It’s not as bad as the prequels.

Redeemed in part by a solid final half-hour, The Last Jedi (henceforth TLJ) is not (quite) as bad as the prequels, but it’s like hearing 1980s hits as played by a mediocre cover band. So many elements in Episode VIII are recycled that it could have been called Rerun of the Jedi.

Picking up where the just-okay The Force Awakens left off, TLJ sets up parallel story lines. At the rebel base, the trigger-happy flyboy Poe (Oscar Isaac) is leading attacks on gigantic Dreadnought ships of the First Order (the Empire’s attempt at rebranding) in a long, meaningless battle sequence that opens the movie with an extravagant thud. General Leia (Carrie Fisher, in her final role) is forever trying to rein Poe in: “Get your head out of your cockpit,” she says. When he says things like, “Permission to jump into the X-wing and blow something up?” you get the feeling this whole struggle-for-survival thing isn’t really registering with him. For no discernible reason except that he is played by one of the stars of the movie, Poe keeps surviving unsurvivable calamities, costing countless comrades their lives without so much as an “Oops.” When he isn’t carelessly destroying rebel equipment, he prank-calls a First Order general (Domhnall Gleeson) whose flustered reaction is pathetic rather than scary.

Meanwhile, the Jedis’ rookie-of-the-year hopeful Rey (Daisy Ridley) has tracked down the loner Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a distant planet where he prefers to let the Jedi die out. Like the Republican party in California, the Jedi were thriving as recently as 30 years ago, but now exist only as memories and legends. Luke blames himself for this state of affairs, what with his prize pupil and nephew, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), having gone over to the Dark Side. The two men have an ongoing he-started-it dispute about whose fault this is.

A huge chunk of the movie is devoted to Luke and Rey doing a lackluster, dinner-theater-in-New-Jersey reprise of Luke’s trip to Yoda’s Dagobah. Only this time, after a weakly motivated change of heart on Luke’s part, he plays the grumpy old sage. There’s a reprise of the Empire Strikes Back cave scene (this time rendered as a hall of mirrors) and a hint that Rey is in thrall to the Dark Side, a twist that is unoriginal and half-hearted, comes out of nowhere, and feels completely wrong for a character who radiates goodness. Later in the movie, there will be an even more blatant ripoff of a key scene from Return of the Jedi, albeit with much cooler costumes and VFX. Did you know a light saber could be turned into a light whip or a light spear? It doesn’t make any difference, but it allows the notoriously easy-to-kill Imperial (sorry, First Order!) soldiers to execute some nifty moves as they get mowed down like dandelions.

If your movie depends on Mark Hamill trying to be Walter Matthau, you’ve got trouble. Why is Luke, previously the most earnest guy in the galaxy, letting loose with acerbic wisecracks? When Rey hands Luke her precious light saber, he tosses it over his shoulder like an empty can of Dr. Pepper. He mocks it as a “laser sword,” while Rey, asked to explain the Force, calls it a “power . . . that makes things float.” The tone here is similar to that of the self-aware jocularity of the progressively less successful 2009–2016 Star Trek series, whose concept is apparently being ditched in favor of an R-rated reboot overseen by Quentin Tarantino. You can go with self-mockery if you want, but it amounts to burning your seed corn to warm your hands. Get a cheap laugh poking fun at the mythology and its power won’t be there when you need it.

Given sole credit as writer and director is Rian Johnson. It seems like a lot to put on the shoulders of a filmmaker with only three previous movies, none of them hits. Compared to Gareth Edwards’s somber-but-effective direction of Rogue One, Johnson’s tone is jarring, as are his choices to give characters never-before-seen powers — conducting transgalactic telepathic Skype calls, flying through space like Mary Poppins. These scenes, strange as they are, get topped in eyeball-scalding pointlessness when the rebel Finn (John Boyega) and a sidekick (Kelly Marie Tran) visit an Abu Dhabi–like pleasure planet of gambling dens and arms dealers and destroy its casino by rampaging through on a herd of giant animals that look like longhorn llamas.

In the process, Finn joins up with a mercenary (Benicio del Toro) who amounts to yet another bit of recycling: he is thrown in to create an outlet for jaded Han Solo–type dialogue. That he is able to defeat any software system in the universe by using metal lock-picking tools suggests Johnson’s level of interest in tech is comparable to that of Hillary Clinton when she wondered whether you could wipe a server with a cloth.

I haven’t even mentioned Laura Dern, who turns up as a lavender-haired admiral. There’s so much else going on in the film that Dern gets 13th billing in its credits. Her character doesn’t make much of an impression but does get to do something really cool involving light speed near the two-hour mark. Unfortunately it’s the first cool thing that happens in the movie, and though it leads to a reasonably rousing and twisty battle scene, I was numbed by all the idiocy that comes before and with it. Does Poe really get jailed for a parking violation? Does BB-8 really overcome an adversary with a fusillade of poker chips? Does an evil First Order warrior in a shiny metal uniform really get called “chrome dome”? Is there really a gag about how the ancient, sacred Jedi texts aren’t exactly “page-turners”? Are there really terriers made out of what appear to be the kind of icicles you hang on a Christmas tree, and are they really called “crystal critters”? Are we really meant to believe wars are won “not fighting what we hate but saving what we love”? Maybe Luke was right. Maybe the Jedi should have been allowed to just die out.

With this report on the way and congressional investigators beginning to zero in on the lack of hard, verified evidence for starting the Trump probe, current and former intelligence and Justice Department officials are dumping everything they can think of to save their reputations.

But it is backfiring. They started by telling the story of Alexander Downer, an Australian diplomat, as having remembered a bar conversation with George PapadopoulosGeorge Demetrios PapadopoulosTrump says he would consider pardons for those implicated in Mueller investigation New FBI document confirms the Trump campaign was investigated without justification Republicans plow ahead with Russia origins probe MORE, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. But how did the FBI know they should talk to him? That’s left out of their narrative. Downer’s signature appears on a $25 million contribution to the Clinton Foundation. You don’t need much imagination to figure that he was close with Clinton Foundation operatives who relayed information to the State Department, which then called the FBI to complete the loop. This wasn’t intelligence. It was likely opposition research from the start.

In no way would a fourth-hand report from a Maltese professor justify wholesale targeting of four or five members of the Trump campaign. It took Christopher Steele, with his funding concealed through false campaign filings, to be incredibly successful at creating a vast echo chamber around his unverified, fanciful dossier, bouncing it back and forth between the press and the FBI so it appeared that there were multiple sources all coming to the same conclusion.

Time and time again, investigators came up empty. Even several sting operations with an FBI spy we just learned about failed to produce a DeLorean-like video with cash on the table. But rather than close the probe, the deep state just expanded it. All they had were a few isolated contacts with Russians and absolutely nothing related to Trump himself, yet they pressed forward. Egged on by Steele, they simply believed Trump and his team must be dirty. They just needed to dig deep enough.

Perhaps the murkiest event in the timeline is Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Rod RosensteinFive takeaways from final Senate Intel Russia report FBI officials hid copies of Russia probe documents fearing Trump interference: book Sally Yates to testify as part of GOP probe into Russia investigation MORE’s appointment of a special counsel after he personally recommended Comey’s firing in blistering terms. With Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsWhite House officials voted by show of hands on 2018 family separations: report Vulnerable Senate Democrat urges unity: 'Not about what side of the aisle we're on' How would a Biden Justice Department be different? MORE shoved out of the way, Rosenstein and Mueller then ignored their own conflicts and took charge anyway. Rosenstein is a fact witness, and Mueller is a friend of Comey, disqualifying them both.

Flush with 16 prosecutors, including a former lawyer for the Clinton Foundation, and an undisclosed budget, the Mueller investigation has been a scorched-earth effort to investigate the entirety of the Trump campaign, Trump business dealings, the entire administration and now, if it was not Russia, maybe it’s some other country.

The president’s earlier legal team was naive in believing that, when Mueller found nothing, he would just end it. Instead, the less investigators found, the more determined and expansive they became. This president and his team now are on a better road to put appropriate limits on all this.

This process must now be stopped, preferably long before a vote in the Senate. Rather than a fair, limited and impartial investigation, the Mueller investigation became a partisan, open-ended inquisition that, by its precedent, is a threat to all those who ever want to participate in a national campaign or an administration again.

Its prosecutions have all been principally to pressure witnesses with unrelated charges and threats to family, or just for a public relations effect, like the indictment of Russian internet trolls. Unfortunately, just like the Doomsday Machine in “Dr. Strangelove” that was supposed to save the world but instead destroys it, the Mueller investigation comes with no “off” switch: You can’t fire Mueller. He needs to be defeated, like Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Clinton.

Finding the “off” switch will not be easy. Step one here is for the Justice Department inspector general report to knock Comey out of the witness box. Next, the full origins of the investigation and its lack of any real intelligence needs to come out in the open. The attorney general, himself the target of a secret investigation, needs to take back his Justice Department. Sessions needs to act quickly, along with U.S. Attorney John Huber, appointed to conduct an internal review of the FBI, on the Comey and McCabe matters following the inspector general report, and then announce an expanded probe into other abuses of power.

The president’s lawyers need to extend their new aggressiveness from words to action, filing complaints with the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility on the failure of Mueller and Rosenstein to recuse themselves and going into court to question the tactics of the special counsel, from selective prosecutions on unrelated matters, illegally seizing Government Services Administration emails, covering up the phone texts of FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and operating without a scope approved by the attorney general. (The regulations call for the attorney general to recuse himself from the investigation but appear to still leave him responsible for the scope.)

The final stopper may be the president himself, offering two hours of testimony, perhaps even televised live from the White House. The last time America became obsessed with Russian influence in America was the McCarthy hearings in the 1950s. Those ended only when Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) attacked an associate of the U.S. Army counsel, Joseph Welch, and Welch famously responded: “Sir, have you no decency?” In this case, virtually every associate and family member of the president has been subject to smears conveniently leaked to the press.

Stopping Mueller isn’t about one president or one party. It’s about all presidents and all parties. It’s about cleaning out and reforming the deep state so that our intelligence operations are never used against opposing campaigns without the firmest of evidence. It’s about letting people work for campaigns and administrations without needing legal defense funds. It’s about relying on our elections to decide our differences.

With this report on the way and congressional investigators beginning to zero in on the lack of hard, verified evidence for starting the Trump probe, current and former intelligence and Justice Department officials are dumping everything they can think of to save their reputations.

But it is backfiring. They started by telling the story of Alexander Downer, an Australian diplomat, as having remembered a bar conversation with George PapadopoulosGeorge Demetrios PapadopoulosTrump says he would consider pardons for those implicated in Mueller investigation New FBI document confirms the Trump campaign was investigated without justification Republicans plow ahead with Russia origins probe MORE, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. But how did the FBI know they should talk to him? That’s left out of their narrative. Downer’s signature appears on a $25 million contribution to the Clinton Foundation. You don’t need much imagination to figure that he was close with Clinton Foundation operatives who relayed information to the State Department, which then called the FBI to complete the loop. This wasn’t intelligence. It was likely opposition research from the start.

In no way would a fourth-hand report from a Maltese professor justify wholesale targeting of four or five members of the Trump campaign. It took Christopher Steele, with his funding concealed through false campaign filings, to be incredibly successful at creating a vast echo chamber around his unverified, fanciful dossier, bouncing it back and forth between the press and the FBI so it appeared that there were multiple sources all coming to the same conclusion.

Time and time again, investigators came up empty. Even several sting operations with an FBI spy we just learned about failed to produce a DeLorean-like video with cash on the table. But rather than close the probe, the deep state just expanded it. All they had were a few isolated contacts with Russians and absolutely nothing related to Trump himself, yet they pressed forward. Egged on by Steele, they simply believed Trump and his team must be dirty. They just needed to dig deep enough.

MORE shoved out of the way, Rosenstein and Mueller then ignored their own conflicts and took charge anyway. Rosenstein is a fact witness, and Mueller is a friend of Comey, disqualifying them both.

Flush with 16 prosecutors, including a former lawyer for the Clinton Foundation, and an undisclosed budget, the Mueller investigation has been a scorched-earth effort to investigate the entirety of the Trump campaign, Trump business dealings, the entire administration and now, if it was not Russia, maybe it’s some other country.

The president’s earlier legal team was naive in believing that, when Mueller found nothing, he would just end it. Instead, the less investigators found, the more determined and expansive they became. This president and his team now are on a better road to put appropriate limits on all this.

This process must now be stopped, preferably long before a vote in the Senate. Rather than a fair, limited and impartial investigation, the Mueller investigation became a partisan, open-ended inquisition that, by its precedent, is a threat to all those who ever want to participate in a national campaign or an administration again.

Its prosecutions have all been principally to pressure witnesses with unrelated charges and threats to family, or just for a public relations effect, like the indictment of Russian internet trolls. Unfortunately, just like the Doomsday Machine in “Dr. Strangelove” that was supposed to save the world but instead destroys it, the Mueller investigation comes with no “off” switch: You can’t fire Mueller. He needs to be defeated, like Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Clinton.

Finding the “off” switch will not be easy. Step one here is for the Justice Department inspector general report to knock Comey out of the witness box. Next, the full origins of the investigation and its lack of any real intelligence needs to come out in the open. The attorney general, himself the target of a secret investigation, needs to take back his Justice Department. Sessions needs to act quickly, along with U.S. Attorney John Huber, appointed to conduct an internal review of the FBI, on the Comey and McCabe matters following the inspector general report, and then announce an expanded probe into other abuses of power.

The president’s lawyers need to extend their new aggressiveness from words to action, filing complaints with the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility on the failure of Mueller and Rosenstein to recuse themselves and going into court to question the tactics of the special counsel, from selective prosecutions on unrelated matters, illegally seizing Government Services Administration emails, covering up the phone texts of FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and operating without a scope approved by the attorney general. (The regulations call for the attorney general to recuse himself from the investigation but appear to still leave him responsible for the scope.)

The final stopper may be the president himself, offering two hours of testimony, perhaps even televised live from the White House. The last time America became obsessed with Russian influence in America was the McCarthy hearings in the 1950s. Those ended only when Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) attacked an associate of the U.S. Army counsel, Joseph Welch, and Welch famously responded: “Sir, have you no decency?” In this case, virtually every associate and family member of the president has been subject to smears conveniently leaked to the press.

Stopping Mueller isn’t about one president or one party. It’s about all presidents and all parties. It’s about cleaning out and reforming the deep state so that our intelligence operations are never used against opposing campaigns without the firmest of evidence. It’s about letting people work for campaigns and administrations without needing legal defense funds. It’s about relying on our elections to decide our differences.

Jerusalem, holy to all three Abrahamic faiths, is at the heart of the territorial conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Israel sees the city as its undivided capital, while the Palestinians consider majority-Arab East Jerusalem to be the future seat of an independent Palestine. No country keeps its embassy there, and the long-standing U.S. position has been that Jerusalem's final status would be determined only as part of a lasting peace deal.

Now, it seems, Trump is set to reverse that order — though not decisively. The president may both officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and do what his predecessors have done for two decades: sign a waiver that comes up twice a year, deferring any shift of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv.

The confused maneuver would create a “situation that leaves us in a half-pregnant state,” Dan Shapiro, who served as U.S. ambassador to Israel under the Obama administration, told Today’s Worldview. “It creates big controversy for little gain. Our broader goal of achieving two states is not advanced, and what this achieves for either side is unclear.”

In recent days, Trump spoke by phone with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, King Abdullah II of Jordan and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, briefing them on his plans regarding Jerusalem. No one seems to have taken the news very well.

“Mr. Trump told our president he was going to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,” Nabil Shaath, an adviser to Abbas, said in an article by my colleagues David Nakamura, Loveday Morris and Anne Gearan. They report that Trump told Abbas that the United States would make future moves that he thought would please the Palestinian people, although he did not offer details. “Our president said, ‘You don’t have anything that would make up for this on Jerusalem.’ He said, ‘Definitely, we will not accept it,’ ” Shaath said.

Meanwhile, Arab governments that have been friendly to Trump issued stern warnings. “King Abdullah stressed that the adoption of this resolution will have serious implications for security and stability in the Middle East, and will undermine the efforts of the American administration to resume the peace process and fuel the feelings of Muslims and Christians,” a statement from Amman read.

According to the Saudi Press Agency, King Salman told the White House that a recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital “would constitute a flagrant provocation of Muslims, all over the world.” The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a body that represents 57 majority-Muslim nations, urged the United States “not to be swayed and aligned with the Israeli occupation and imperialism.”

Palestinian factions have announced three “days of rage,” starting Wednesday, to protest a potential embassy move. They see recognition of an “undivided” Jerusalem as the Israeli capital as a tacit acceptance of the continued Israeli military occupation of the Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem. The U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem warned U.S. nationals and government employees of potential threats to their safety, and Palestinians burned effigies of Trump in the city of Bethlehem on Tuesday night.

“A decision such as this is both morally wrong and politically dangerous,” Yousef Munayyer, executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, told Today’s WorldView. “Not only is Donald Trump deliberately insulting the Palestinian people, but also Arabs and Muslims around the world. In doing so, he is relinquishing what little credibility the United States had left in a region that is already rife with conflict and division.”

Ayman Odeh, an Arab Israeli lawmaker and head of the third-largest bloc in Israel’s parliament, was even more blunt. “Trump is a pyromaniac who could set the region on fire with his madness,” he wrote on Twitter.

Shapiro, the former U.S. ambassador, contends that there is theoretically no harm in moving the U.S. Embassy to West Jerusalem — provided, first, that Trump makes clear that East Jerusalem has a different status and, second, that he conducts “a lot of preparatory diplomacy and consultation.” Trump would need to consult with Arab officials in particular to minimize backlash and keep Palestinian officials willing to negotiate.

But Trump’s decision has reportedly taken Arab leaders largely by surprise, raising questions about the White House's ultimate strategy and intentions. It also calls into question the future of the administration’s effort to restart the peace process. “The United States has attempted to shepherd the so-called ‘peace process’ on the basis that it can play the role of mediator. But by clearly adopting an Israeli position as its own, it makes clear it is not even pretending anymore,” Munayyer said.

The administration could be banking on a changing environment in the Middle East, with the region fractured by the Saudi-Iranian rivalry and Israel developing closer ties with a host of Arab states, including Saudi Arabia. But that may prove to be a mistaken gambit.

“The move would go against the very priorities that the administration has set for itself in the Middle East: fighting Islamist militancy and confronting Iranian influence,” wrote Shibley Telhami of the Brookings Institution. “Jerusalem is the perfect issue for Iran and Islamist militants to use to mobilize support against the United States and those who endorse its policies.”

Over the weekend, the president’s son-in-law and Middle East peace envoy, Jared Kushner, told a Washington gathering that Trump had not made a final decision on Jerusalem. “He’s still looking at a lot of different facts. And then, when he makes his decision, he’ll be the one to want to tell you, not me,” Kushner said.

And if Trump does decide in favor of a move, Kushner’s task may be simply impossible. “If you’re about to launch a major peace plan,” said Ilan Goldenberg of the Center for a New American Security, “the last thing you want to do is take this highly sensitive question of Jerusalem and just throw it into the mix.”","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

1241.0,"This week Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight crimes, six counts of tax evasion and bank fraud and two violations of campaign finance laws: (1) making an illegally large $130,000 campaign contribution and (2) causing an illegal $150,000 corporate campaign contribution. In the process of pleading guilty, Cohen directly implicated President Donald Trump in violations of campaign finance laws—violations of the sort that led to an unsuccessful criminal prosecution of 2008 Presidential candidate John Edwards. The case against Trump is much stronger than was the case against Edwards. Indeed, the case against Trump would turn the weaknesses in Edwards’ case into strengths.

But first a little more about Cohen and the implications for Trump.

The Important Facts and How the Law Works

One of Cohen’s campaign finance violations relates to his use of his own money to make a $130,000 “hush” payment to adult film actress Stephanie Clifford (a.k.a. Stormy Daniels) in October 2016. Cohen’s other campaign finance violation relates to his collaboration with tabloid publishing corporation American Media Inc. (AMI) in its $150,000 “catch and kill” payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal in August 2016. Both women claim to have had affairs with Trump a decade before receiving payments from Cohen and AMI.

Cohen’s guilty plea didn’t surprise me. I spotted these violations early this year and, on behalf of the nonpartisan group Common Cause, we filed complaints with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Election Commission (FEC) in January regarding the Clifford payment, in February regarding the McDougal payment, and another one in March regarding the Clifford payment. These complaints included allegations that Cohen made an illegal $130,000 contribution and AMI made an illegal $150,000 contribution to the Trump campaign. Common Cause also alleged violations by Trump, the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization—allegations that seem even more well-founded after the Cohen guilty plea.

What did surprise me, however, were the statements Cohen made during his court appearance to enter his plea agreement. Cohen told the presiding judge under oath that the payments to Clifford and McDougal were made “in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,” a clear reference to then-candidate Trump. Cohen stated further: “I participated in this conduct … for the principal purpose of influencing the election” for president in 2016. These sworn statements by Cohen directly implicate the president in at least four violations of federal campaign finance law, which are criminally enforced, and potentially other federal offences.

There’s added reason to trust what Cohen said in the courthouse compared to what he may have previously told the press. He made these claims under penalty of perjury. He also made the statements pending sentencing. Lying to or even just misleading the judge in that situation could have dire consequences for the amount of time he spends in prison. Lastly, if prosecutors had reason to think Cohen’s statement was false, they were under an obligation to inform the judge immediately. They didn’t.

A violation of campaign finance law is only a crime punishable by imprisonment, as opposed to a civil offense punishable only by fine, if an individual’s violation of the restrictions was knowing and willful. As explained in the Department of Justice manual, Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses, federal campaign finance law violations “become potential crimes when they are committed knowingly and willfully, that is, by an offender who knew what the law forbade and violated it notwithstanding that knowledge.” That’s an important qualification to keep in mind. It means that knowledge of the law is, in some sense, an excuse or get-out-of-jail free card in this arena. And it is prosecutors who would have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant acted with this state of mind.

The Prosecution of John Edwards Versus the Case Against Trump

Cohen’s statements in court this week, if true, establish that Trump was personally involved in multiple violations of federal law and also severely undermine the viability of what I’ll call the “Edwards defense,” which Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has already publicly asserted on Trump’s behalf.

Federal prosecutors charged 2008 Democratic Presidential candidate John Edwards for allegedly orchestrating nearly $1 million in payments by two wealthy Edwards supporters to hide his pregnant mistress, Rielle Hunter, from public view in the latter half of 2007. The Department of Justice argued that the payments to his mistress Hunter constituted illegally large and unreported in-kind contributions to the Edwards campaign. Sound familiar? Edwards argued that the purpose of the payments was to hide his affair from his wife who was battling cancer at the time, not to hide his affair from voters. In other words, Edwards claimed the reason for the payments was personal and not political.

Some commentators claim Edwards was vindicated, and that his case shows that his alleged activities would not amount to a crime. That’s wrong. The jury was unable to reach a unanimous conclusion on five of six counts Edwards faced, and acquitted him on a count related to a payment made after he had dropped out of the presidential race. The law is still a strong one that regulates all federal elections. The failure of Edwards’ prosecution boils down to weaknesses in some of the claims the government made and evidence against him.

Indeed, Common Cause has alleged very similar violations of law by Trump in our DOJ and FEC complaints. Specifically, we allege that Trump violated federal law by receiving illegal contributions from Cohen and AMI in the form of payments made to McDougal and Daniels, and by failing to report these contributions to the FEC.

These campaign finance laws apply only to payments made “for the purpose of influencing an election,” a phrase that’s critical to the statutory definitions of “contribution” and “expenditure.” Several factual distinctions make the case against Trump stronger than was the case against Edwards, specifically with respect to any asserted “personal not political” defense.

1. Fear of Media Exposure

First, in the Edwards prosecution, DOJ presented no evidence that Hunter was planning or threatening to speak to the press about her affair with Edwards. Edwards’ lawyers made a big deal out of this at trial, arguing that the payments were intended to keep news of Edwards’ affair from his very-ill wife, not from the voting public. By contrast, regarding the payments at issue in the Trump/Cohen matter, both McDougal and Clifford were in negotiation with national media outlets to sell the rights to their stories of affairs with Trump. McDougal and Clifford understood that the rapidly-approaching presidential general election gave them leverage over Trump. These facts are highly relevant to the motive and purpose of the payments.

2. Timing of Payments and the Election

Second, all but one of the payments made to Hunter on behalf of Edwards were made before a single primary ballot had been cast, in the calendar year preceding the election year. The one exception was a late January 2008 payment after Edwards had dropped out of the presidential race—the count on which he was acquitted. By contrast, the two payments related to Cohen’s guilty plea came in August (McDougal) and October (Clifford) of the election year, immediately before Americans voted in the general election. This timing is relevant to the likely purpose of the payments. (It may be useful to recall that Trump’s own lawyer Giuliani admitted this was the purpose of the Daniels payments in discussing its timing.)

3. Timing of the Payments and the Affairs

Third, the payments to Hunter on behalf of Edwards were made contemporaneously to the affair and the pregnancy—timing that arguably makes sense if the true purpose was to keep knowledge of the affair from Edwards’ wife. By contrast, the payments to both McDougal and Clifford were made a decade after the alleged affairs—timing that doesn’t make much sense if the purpose was to keep knowledge of the affairs from Mrs. Trump, but makes a lot of sense (combined with the proximity to the election) if the purpose was to keep the information from voters in order to influence the election.

4. Witnesses

Finally, whereas the sources of allegedly illegal payments in the Edwards prosecution were unavailable to testify at trial regarding the purposes of their payments (Fred Baron died in 2008 and Rachel “Bunny” Mellon was 101 years old and unable to travel and testify), Michael Cohen, the source of one of the Trump-related payments, stated in court this week that his payment was “for the principal purpose of influencing the election.” Cohen’s plea documents indicate a host of other people were involved in the scheme. According to the Wall Street Journal, one of those individuals, the President of AMI has already “provided prosecutors with details about payments … including Mr. Trump’s knowledge of the deals.”

* * *

To be clear, I don’t mean to imply that a criminal prosecution of President Trump for campaign finance violations would be an easy case—or that it could be done at all. Some of the sharpest legal minds in the nation disagree over whether a sitting President can be prosecuted for any crimes while he remains in office. And even if prosecution were possible, conviction would require proof that Trump knew his actions were forbidden by law and violated the law notwithstanding that knowledge.

Instead, I detail these factual distinctions between the Edwards and Trump matters to push back on the assumption that because Edwards wasn’t convicted, Trump’s actions didn’t violate the law or that federal prosecutors would not have a formidable case against him. Trump may not be held accountable for his actions in a court of law, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t break laws getting elected in 2016. That’s a matter for the court of public opinion. And the case against Trump is strong.

Specifically, we allege that Trump violated federal law by receiving illegal contributions from Cohen and AMI in the form of payments made to McDougal and Daniels, and by failing to report these contributions to the FEC.

These campaign finance laws apply only to payments made “for the purpose of influencing an election,” a phrase that’s critical to the statutory definitions of “contribution” and “expenditure.” Several factual distinctions make the case against Trump stronger than was the case against Edwards, specifically with respect to any asserted “personal not political” defense.

1. Fear of Media Exposure

First, in the Edwards prosecution, DOJ presented no evidence that Hunter was planning or threatening to speak to the press about her affair with Edwards. Edwards’ lawyers made a big deal out of this at trial, arguing that the payments were intended to keep news of Edwards’ affair from his very-ill wife, not from the voting public. By contrast, regarding the payments at issue in the Trump/Cohen matter, both McDougal and Clifford were in negotiation with national media outlets to sell the rights to their stories of affairs with Trump. McDougal and Clifford understood that the rapidly-approaching presidential general election gave them leverage over Trump. These facts are highly relevant to the motive and purpose of the payments.

2. Timing of Payments and the Election

Second, all but one of the payments made to Hunter on behalf of Edwards were made before a single primary ballot had been cast, in the calendar year preceding the election year. The one exception was a late January 2008 payment after Edwards had dropped out of the presidential race—the count on which he was acquitted. By contrast, the two payments related to Cohen’s guilty plea came in August (McDougal) and October (Clifford) of the election year, immediately before Americans voted in the general election. This timing is relevant to the likely purpose of the payments. (It may be useful to recall that Trump’s own lawyer Giuliani admitted this was the purpose of the Daniels payments in discussing its timing.)

3. Timing of the Payments and the Affairs

Third, the payments to Hunter on behalf of Edwards were made contemporaneously to the affair and the pregnancy—timing that arguably makes sense if the true purpose was to keep knowledge of the affair from Edwards’ wife. By contrast, the payments to both McDougal and Clifford were made a decade after the alleged affairs—timing that doesn’t make much sense if the purpose was to keep knowledge of the affairs from Mrs. Trump, but makes a lot of sense (combined with the proximity to the election) if the purpose was to keep the information from voters in order to influence the election.

4. Witnesses

Finally, whereas the sources of allegedly illegal payments in the Edwards prosecution were unavailable to testify at trial regarding the purposes of their payments (Fred Baron died in 2008 and Rachel “Bunny” Mellon was 101 years old and unable to travel and testify), Michael Cohen, the source of one of the Trump-related payments, stated in court this week that his payment was “for the principal purpose of influencing the election.” Cohen’s plea documents indicate a host of other people were involved in the scheme. According to the Wall Street Journal, one of those individuals, the President of AMI has already “provided prosecutors with details about payments … including Mr. Trump’s knowledge of the deals.”

* * *

To be clear, I don’t mean to imply that a criminal prosecution of President Trump for campaign finance violations would be an easy case—or that it could be done at all. Some of the sharpest legal minds in the nation disagree over whether a sitting President can be prosecuted for any crimes while he remains in office. And even if prosecution were possible, conviction would require proof that Trump knew his actions were forbidden by law and violated the law notwithstanding that knowledge.

Instead, I detail these factual distinctions between the Edwards and Trump matters to push back on the assumption that because Edwards wasn’t convicted, Trump’s actions didn’t violate the law or that federal prosecutors would not have a formidable case against him. Trump may not be held accountable for his actions in a court of law, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t break laws getting elected in 2016. That’s a matter for the court of public opinion. And the case against Trump is strong.

1242.0,"Kansas City Chiefs players take a knee during the national anthem (Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports/Reuters)

President Trump’s call for NFL players who take a knee during the national anthem to be fired was a troubling assault on free speech — and it put the league in an impossible position.

Americans do not and should not worship idols. We do not and should not worship the flag. As a nation we stand in respect for the national anthem and stand in respect for the flag not simply because we were born here or because it’s our flag. We stand in respect because the flag represents a specific set of values and principles: that all men are created equal and that we are endowed with our Creator with certain unalienable rights.

Advertisement

These ideals were articulated in the Declaration of Independence, codified in the Constitution, and defended with the blood of patriots. Central to them is the First Amendment, the guarantee of free expression against government interference and government reprisal that has made the United States unique among the world’s great powers. Arguably, it is the single most important liberty of all, because it enables the defense of all the others: Without the right to speak freely we cannot even begin to point out offenses against the rest of the Constitution.

Now, with that as a backdrop, which is the greater danger to the ideals embodied by the American flag, a few football players’ taking a knee at the national anthem or the most powerful man in the world’s demanding that they be fired and their livelihoods destroyed for engaging in speech he doesn’t like?

As my colleague Jim Geraghty notes this morning, too many in our polarized nation have lately developed a disturbing habit of zealously defending the free speech of people they like while working overtime to find reasons to justify censoring their ideological enemies. How many leftists who were yelling “free speech” yesterday are only too happy to sic the government on the tiny few bakers or florists who don’t want to use their artistic talents to celebrate events they find offensive? How many progressives who celebrated the First Amendment on Sunday sympathize with college students who chant “speech is violence” and seek to block conservatives from college campuses?

The hypocrisy runs the other way, too. I was startled to see many conservatives who decried Google’s termination of a young, dissenting software engineer work overtime yesterday to argue that Trump was somehow in the right. Yet Google is a private corporation and Trump is the most powerful government official in the land. The First Amendment applies to Trump, not Google, and his demands for reprisals are ultimately far more ominous, given his job, than even the actions of the largest corporations. Google, after all, has competitors. Google commands no police force. Everything it does is replaceable.

In the space of less than 24 hours this weekend, the president of the United States did more to politicize sports than ESPN has done in a decade of biased, progressive programming. He singled out free speech he didn’t like, demanded that dissenters be fired, and then — when it became clear that private American citizens weren’t going to do what he demanded — he urged the economic boycott of their entire industry.

He told his political opponents on the football field — men who have defined their lives and careers by their mental and physical toughness — to essentially, “Do what I say or lose your job.” In so doing, he put them in straits far more difficult to navigate than anything Colin Kaepernick has wrought: Stand and they are seen to obey a man who just abused his office, and millions of Americans will view them as a sellout not just to the political cause they love but also to the Constitution itself; kneel and they defy a rogue president, but millions of Americans will view them as disrespecting the nation itself to score political points against a president those Americans happen to like.

At one stroke, thanks to an attempted vulgar display of strength, Trump changed the playing of the anthem and the display of the flag from a moment where all but the most radical Americans could unite to one where millions of well-meaning Americans could and did legitimately believe that the decision to kneel represented a defense of the ideals of the flag, not defiance of the nation they love.

If we no longer fight to secure the same rights for others that we demand for ourselves, we become more tribal, and America becomes less exceptional.

So, yes, I understand why they knelt. I understand why men who would never otherwise bring politics onto the playing field — and never had politicized sports before — felt that they could not be seen to comply with a demagogue’s demands. I understand why even owners who gave millions to Trump expressed solidarity with their players. I understand why even Trump supporters like Rex Ryan were appalled at the president’s actions.

I fear that those who proclaimed yesterday’s events a “win” for the president — after all, many of the players were booed for their stance, and in American politics you generally don’t want to be seen as taking sides against the flag — are missing the forest for the trees. If we lose respect for the First Amendment, then politics becomes purely about power. If we no longer fight to secure the same rights for others that we demand for ourselves, we become more tribal, and America becomes less exceptional.

I respect Pittsburgh Steelers left tackle (and former Army ranger) Alejandro Villanueva, who — alone among his teammates — came out of the locker room to stand for the pledge while the rest of his team remained off the field. I also respect players who reluctantly, but acting out of the conviction that they will not be bullied by the president, chose to kneel when they otherwise never would. I do not, however, respect the actions of Donald Trump. This weekend, he didn’t make America great. He made its politics worse.

When the history of this unfortunate, polarized era of American life is written, whether a man stood or knelt will matter far less than the values we all lived by. Americans who actually defend the letter and spirit of the First Amendment will stand (or kneel) proudly in the history books. Those who seek to punish their political opponents’ speech, on the other hand, can stand or kneel as they wish — so long as they hang their heads in shame.

1332.0,"Her campaign is linked to at least three separate pieces of information fed to the FBI, including the dossier the FBI used as a pretext to spy on a Trump campaign associate.

A significant part of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s basis for investigating the Trump campaign’s Russia ties is looking more and more like a political hit job carried out by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign. Her campaign’s fingerprints are on at least three separate pieces of information fed to the FBI, including the Christopher Steele dossier Republicans say formed the basis of a secret warrant obtained to spy on Trump campaign associate Carter Page.

A former State Department official confirmed on the record Thursday that Clinton associates were funneling information to Steele as he was compiling a dossier commissioned and paid for by the Clinton campaign and DNC. That’s on top of the recent revelation that a top Department of Justice official fed the FBI information compiled by his wife, who was working for the firm Clinton and the DNC were paying to dig up dirt on Trump, Fusion GPS.

The dossier was quoted “extensively” in the FBI’s application to obtain a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, according to a memo released by Republicans on the House intelligence committee. In a January letter to the FBI made public this week, two Senate Republicans also said Steele’s information formed a “significant portion” of the warrant application.

“It is troubling enough that the Clinton Campaign funded Mr. Steele’s work, but that these Clinton associates were contemporaneously feeding Mr. Steele allegations raises additional concerns about his credibility,” Sens. Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, and Lindsey Graham wrote in the letter referring Steele to the FBI for a criminal investigation.

Taken together, here’s what we know so far about the extent of Clinton’s involvement in the FBI’s case.

1. Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal funneled information to the FBI through a contact at the State Department.

In an account published by The Washington Post, former State Department official Jonathan Winer describes how research compiled by a Clinton ally made its way into his hands and then to the FBI. Winer was in charge of combating transnational organized crime at the State Department under Bill Clinton in the 1990s, and returned under the Obama administration to work on international law enforcement. Between his two gigs, he became friends with Steele, who as a result began feeding information to the State Department, and tipped Winer off in Sept. 2016 to the Trump dossier he was compiling.

That same month, Winer met Blumenthal, who provided him with notes on Trump and Russia compiled by another Clinton insider, Cody Shearer. “What struck me was how some of the material echoed Steele’s but appeared to involve different sources,” Winer writes in The Washington Post. He decided to show the notes to Steele, who told him the information could be used to corroborate his dossier. Steele walked away with a copy of the notes, which he provided to the FBI.

Shearer and Blumenthal, known respectively as “Mr. Fixer” and “Vicious Sid” in Clinton world, are staunch allies of the Clintons. Winer notes he didn’t know whether the information Blumenthal fed him was accurate, but says he fed it to Steel anyway because he was “alarmed at Russia’s role in the 2016 election.”

Grassley and Graham express concern in their criminal referral that Steele was “vulnerable to manipulation” while compiling his dossier on Trump, as he has admitted to meeting with at least four different news outlets during that time (in violation of an agreement he had with the FBI), and indicated he received unsolicited and unverified tips on Trump and included them in his dossier. “Simply put, the more people who contemporaneously knew that Mr. Steele was compiling his dossier, the more likely it was vulnerable to manipulation,” they wrote in their letter.

Of course, the Clinton network knew to some extent about the dossier, since Hillary’s campaign and the DNC had commissioned and funded the effort through Fusion GPS. Whether Blumenthal was planting bogus information to manipulate Steele or passing along what he regarded as a legitimate tip is unclear, but it’s certainly not a good look.

Regardless, this second unverified and unsolicited dossier made its way to the FBI thanks to the Clinton camp.

2. Steele was at that same time compiling a dossier paid for by the Clinton campaign and the DNC.

As noted, Steele was already well into work on a dossier paid for by the Clinton campaign and DNC regarding Trump’s Russia ties when Winer approached him. Perkins Coie, a law firm representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, had hired Fusion GPS to dig up opposition research on Trump prior to the election. Fusion in turn employed Steele, a former British spy, to compile the dossier. His work was entirely funded by Democrats.

The FBI was never able to verify the salacious claims in Steele’s dossier, so relied heavily on his reputation to infuse the document with credibility before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court, according to the Republican memo and criminal referral. The bureau continued to vouch for him before the court in subsequent applications to renew the warrant, even after learning he was “desperate” to stop Trump from getting elected, had broken the bureau’s trust by dishing to the press in one case, and potentially lied to the bureau outright in several other instances — a criminal offense. The court learned none of this, and continued to grant the FBI permission to spy on a U.S. citizen based in part on Steele’s research.

3. A top DOJ official fed the FBI research on Trump from his wife also paid for by the Clinton campaign and the DNC.

The third piece of information provided to the FBI in connection with Clinton allies is research compiled by the wife of former senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, who worked closely with Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and her replacement, Rod Rosenstein. Ohr was also a friend of Steele.

Ohr’s wife was employed by Fusion GPS to help compile opposition research on Trump. According to the Republican memo, Ohr eventually turned over all of the information she compiled — while working ultimately for the Clinton campaign and the DNC — to the FBI. It’s unclear whether this information made it into the FISA applications, but it’s one more example of evidence received by the FBI that can be traced back to the Clinton campaign.

According to the Republican memo, the FISA court was never informed of the Ohr’s connections to Fusion GPS and Steele.

In sum: To obtain a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate, the FBI relied heavily on a dossier that was never substantiated, put together by a former spy “desperate” to stop Trump. That dossier was paid for by powerful Democrats on Trump’s rival campaign, who also paid for opposition research the FBI received from a powerful couple inside President Obama’s DOJ. Separately, two Clinton allies worked together to funnel a second unsubstantiated dossier to the FBI through the State Department.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

1426.0,"Juice has had a bad reputation for years. That’s because concoctions like Capri Sun and SunnyD have probably made more than a few rounds at breakfast and lunch, spiking your added sugar and calorie intake.

Believe it or not, though, certain juices can actually be really good for you. The key is to look for 100 percent on the label to ensure your drink contains just fruit or vegetables and no added sugar. You can also take a peek at the ingredients list. If it’s just the fruit or vegetable, you’re good to go.

The juice will still be high in the sweet stuff, but you’ll be taking in natural sugars, rather than the processed kind that can mess with your health.

Not to mention, these pure juices contain added benefits that you won’t always find listed on the bottle. Pick the right kind, and one glass may even pack a bigger nutritional bang for your buck than a single piece of fruit. The following 100 percent juice varieties serve up a ton of health perks in a small container, no chewing required. Drink up!

TART CHERRY JUICE

manufacturer

This juice may be a little hard to swallow, but its athletic benefits make it worthwhile.

“Because of the high concentration of vitamins C and E (two powerful antioxidants), 100 percent tart cherry juice has been shown to help reduce muscle soreness and weakness post exercise,” says Elizabeth Shaw, M.S., R.D.N., C.L.T. Plus, preliminary research suggests that tart cherry juice may help you sleep more soundly.

As an added bonus, ""just 4 ounces of 100 percent tart cherry juice provides all of your daily vitamin C,” says Shaw, which is crucial for healthy sperm. As the name suggests, tart cherry juice is a bit sour, so try adding it to a smoothie to balance out the taste.

“One study found that cyclists who drank two cups of beetroot juice daily increased their speed and oxygen output, indicating that this juice may enhance endurance,” says Palinski-Wade. Not only that, but recent research found that beets may also help speed up your recovery after a tough workout, since the nitrates help calm the inflammation in your muscles, too.

Many find a 70 milliliter (2.4 ounces) concentrated shot of beetroot juice to be much more palatable than an entire 300 milliliter glass of juice, and both have similar amounts of nitrates.

Try this: , made with 98% concentrated beetroot juice and a touch of lemon juice.

POMEGRANATE JUICE

manufacturer

Pure pomegranate juice is made by pressing the entire pomegranate, including the rind and pith, into each 8 ounce bottle. This process yields juice from 2 whole-pressed pomegranate and nothing else — no added sugar, colors, or preservatives.

Those ruby red pomegranates are packed with antioxidants that provide a wide array of health benefits. “Not only is 100 percent pomegranate juice being studied for its effects on memory and cognition, but a preliminary study found that 8 ounces of 100 percent pomegranate juice daily may increase post-exercise arm and leg strength,” says Shaw.

Another bonus? Preliminary research also suggests that drinking pomegranate juice may actually stall the growth of prostate cancer cells.

That’s because concoctions like Capri Sun and SunnyD have probably made more than a few rounds at breakfast and lunch, spiking your added sugar and calorie intake.

Believe it or not, though, certain juices can actually be really good for you. The key is to look for 100 percent on the label to ensure your drink contains just fruit or vegetables and no added sugar. You can also take a peek at the ingredients list. If it’s just the fruit or vegetable, you’re good to go.

The juice will still be high in the sweet stuff, but you’ll be taking in natural sugars, rather than the processed kind that can mess with your health.

Not to mention, these pure juices contain added benefits that you won’t always find listed on the bottle. Pick the right kind, and one glass may even pack a bigger nutritional bang for your buck than a single piece of fruit. The following 100 percent juice varieties serve up a ton of health perks in a small container, no chewing required. Drink up!

TART CHERRY JUICE

This juice may be a little hard to swallow, but its athletic benefits make it worthwhile.

“Because of the high concentration of vitamins C and E (two powerful antioxidants), 100 percent tart cherry juice has been shown to help reduce muscle soreness and weakness post exercise,” says Elizabeth Shaw, M.S., R.D.N., C.L.T. Plus, preliminary research suggests that tart cherry juice may help you sleep more soundly.

As an added bonus, ""just 4 ounces of 100 percent tart cherry juice provides all of your daily vitamin C,” says Shaw, which is crucial for healthy sperm. As the name suggests, tart cherry juice is a bit sour, so try adding it to a smoothie to balance out the taste.

PRUNE JUICE

Prune juice is making a comeback because it contains a hearty helping of the F word: fiber. “The majority of Americans fall short on their daily fiber needs, meeting only about half of their daily goal,” says Erin Palinski-Wade, R.D., C.D.E. author of Belly Fat Diet For Dummies.

If you’re feeling a little backed up after the heavy holiday meals, try sipping 8 ounces of prune juice to help with digestion. “With 3 grams of fiber per serving, it’s an easy way to boost fiber intake and maintain digestive health,” says Palinski-Wade.

She also notes that prune juice is a good source of heart healthy potassium and provides five essential vitamins and minerals, like vitamin A and iron.

If you think your morning glass of OJ has too much of the sweet stuff, think again. The 100 percent juice varieties are made from pressed oranges with no added sugar. A glass of OJ contains more than a day’s worth of your vitamin C needs and packs as much potassium as a medium banana, an essential nutrient for muscle contraction and hydration. Plus, many varieties are fortified with bone-boosting calcium and vitamin D.

“The majority of Americans don’t get enough fruit in their diet, and an 8-ounce glass of orange juice counts as one of your daily recommended servings of fruit,” says Alissa Rumsey M.S., R.D.

That small bottle of grape-flavored juice you drank as a kid is a notorious sugar bomb—but choose 100 percent juice and you don’t have much to worry about. While its label will tout some of its health benefits, like that it’s an excellent source of vitamin C, it won’t tell you that it has over 250 milligrams of polyphenols. These powerful plant nutrients provide many of the same heart health benefits that red wine is known for.

Plus, early research suggests that drinking grape juice may help keep your mind sharp as you age.

There are two MLKs.

There once was a man named Martin Luther King Jr. who actually lived and breathed. He was a radical who believed in the redistribution of wealth, argued for slave reparations and that wrote that moderate whites who didn’t speak out on racism were just as bad as the Ku Klux Klan. Seventy-five percent of Americans disapproved of that man when he was killed by a white supremacist in 1968.

Advertisement

Then, there is the Martin Luther King Jr. that exists in the collective white memory. Through a complex combination of whitewashing, self-guilt and the intentional rewriting of history that absolves them of their hatred, they have painted a sanitized, impressionist portrait of a civil rights icon whose dreams were fulfilled by America’s unwavering commitment to justice and equality.

Out of whole cloth, they managed to fabricate a fantastic hologram of King that is ahistorical, but still “based on a true story.” Their Martin was a lover, not a fighter. They remember a socially conservative, respectable reconciler; not an anti-establishment revolutionary. And, for their sake, his doctrine of nonviolent resistance was eventually reduced to simple “nonviolence.”

This is the King they will remember this weekend.

There are two Americas.

There once was a country who stole whole human beings from another continent, dragged them across an ocean and kept them as property out back while they created a country based on the universal laws of freedom and liberty. Even when that country, in theory, realized the hypocrisy of its ways, the only way it could end slavery was by fighting what still stands as the bloodiest war in that country’s history. Then Jim Crow... yadda yadda... The civil rights movement...blah blah blah... The Civil Rights Act and, viola —equality!

Then there is the America that exists in the white mind.

Even the most obstinately delusional acolyte for post-racial America will not say that racism has been eliminated. They will, however, tell you how much better things have gotten. They honestly think that most white people are not racist and that America is not a racist country. They believe that everyone in America has access to the “American dream” that only exists in the Caucasian imagination.

Advertisement

On Saturday, the Boston Globe published a piece by writer Jeff Jacoby explaining that racism in America has been reduced to only a “minor problem” that has grown “less toxic and less entrenched.”

Advertisement

Jacoby laughably supported his argument by cherry-picking polls and statistics that reveal how white people are now willing to allow negro families to live next door; how whites have more black friends than they once did and how black people are now free to date outside their race.

Seriously, that’s his entire body of evidence.

Jacoby concludes his picture of this utopian America by writing:

None of this is to claim that racial ugliness has vanished outright, or that racial concerns can be safely ignored. It is to claim that despite the occasional eruption of racist hatred or cruelty, and despite the coarse racial crudeness of the incumbent president, the American people are far removed from the bigots of yesteryear. In less than two generations, the United States transformed itself from a largely racist society to a largely non-racist one. “We shall overcome,” King and the civil rights heroes vowed. Inspired by their courage, uplifted by their moral leadership, Americans did just that.

Advertisement

I can’t blame Jacoby and those of his ilk for stanning for that version of America. It sounds like Wakanda for white people. Oh, how beautifully reassuring it must be to believe that the combination of hard work and hope can turn fiction into a tangible thing and that hatred and cruelty have been reduced to “occasional eruptions.”

I want to live in that America, too.



Every day, the staff of The Root lays out a list of the stories we will cover. As the list grows, at least once a day, someone will announce that they have discovered a brand new story that we missed. Many times, that story has been covered by another writer on staff, or it has already been discussed. When this happens, someone will invariably quote one of two recurring inside jokes.

Advertisement

Either they will say “Michael Harriot doesn’t read The Root,” (Yes, I am probably the most frequent butt of this joke) or they will just point to the long list of stories we have decided to cover and say:

“Scroll up.”

Apparently, Jeff Jacoby doesn’t read The Root, the news, anything written by or about Martin Luther King Jr. or American history.

Advertisement

If he did, he’d know a little more about racism, MLK or America’s past and present.

Even white liberals and progressives believe racism is an invisible feeling of hatred and intolerance that only exists in the minds of Nazis, Klansmen and people named Donald Trump. Like white people have done with the memory of Martin Luther King Jr., Jacoby has finessed the definition of racism until it has become microscopically narrow. They think it is as abstruse as liberty or freedom. But racism is a tangible, measurable thing.

Advertisement

Instead of postulating about feelings and sentiment we can examine the actual words in Dr. King’s most famous speech and see how much progress America has made on race.

In his “I Have a Dream” speech, King said:

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

Advertisement

If there exists a “table of brotherhood” in Georgia, it is the voting booth. In 1964, the year before the passage of the Voting Rights Act, an NAACP report said black voting registration numbers were kept low because of “systematic programs of repression, reprisal, trickery and intimidation.”

Fifty-four years later, Georgia’s black voters were kept from sitting at the table of brotherhood by former secretary of State and current governor, Brian Kemp, who used a new-millennium system of voter suppression that targeted black voters with “reprisal, trickery and intimidation.”

Advertisement

There is non-debatable data and accessible court rulings that show how Kemp and others purge black voter registrations, disproportionately toss out ballots in majority-black districts and disqualify black voters. No one can quantify how white Georgians feel about black people but, again, racism has little to do with feelings.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

Advertisement

According to the Sentencing Project, 7.4 percent of African Americans in this country are disenfranchised because of felony convictions. Mississippi’s black felony disenfranchisement rate is twice the national average and the state incarcerates three black people for every white person it sends to prison. Black receive prison sentences that are 20 percent longer than whites who commit the same crime. In 2018, this “largely non-racist” utopia continued to arrest, incarcerate and kill black people disproportionately.

So much for the dream about an oasis of justice and freedom.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

Advertisement

A 2014 study published in the American Psychological Association’s Journal of Personality and Social Psychology revealed that black boys are viewed as older and less innocent than whites kids the same size and age. A 2017 study found the same is true for black girls.

I wonder why Jacoby left that out?

I have a dream that one day down in Alabama — with its vicious racists, with its Governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification — one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

Almost every expert and academic agrees that American schools are as segregated now as they were in the 1960s. In 1968, at the time of King’s death in 1968, 23 percent of black children in the South attended schools that were 50 percent white. In 2018, the UCLA Civil Rights Project used Department of Education data to show that 23 percent of children in the south attend schools that are at least 50 percent white.



In 2018, a federal appeals court struck down a decision that allowed white parents in Gardendale, Ala. to segregate their white neighborhood schools from a majority black school district. The judge noted that “the Gardendale Board acted with a discriminatory purpose to exclude black children from the proposed school system.”

Advertisement

It’s hard to hold hands from that far away.

America is now as it was then. It is two things.



For white people, this country is a beautiful illusion. It remains a land of bounty, filled with endless possibilities for them. It fertilizes their hopes and turns their dreams into reality. And, in their minds, nothing as incredibly fantastic as this can be simultaneously racist.

Advertisement

For us, America is simply a place. We have never been able to afford the rose-colored glasses that filter out our nation’s blemishes. It is impossible for us to forgive and forget this country’s original sin — not because we bear the scars — but because this country, year after year — continues to pour salt into the wound.

But before Jeff Jacoby, the Boston Globe and the believers in the “largely-non-racist America” take their idealized icon’s advice to “join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: ‘Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last,’” perhaps they should do one thing:

1643.0,"Philadelphia’s police commissioner on Saturday defended officers who arrested two black men at a Starbucks, prompting accusations of racism on social media, concern from the mayor and an apology from the company.

Videos posted online show officers handcuffing the men in the downtown establishment on Thursday. A white man in the video is heard saying he was meeting with the men and calls the arrest “ridiculous.”

Commissioner Richard Ross said Starbucks employees called 911 to say the men were trespassing. He said officers were told that the men had come in and asked to use the restroom but were denied because they hadn’t bought anything, as he said is company policy. He said they then refused to leave.

Ross, who is black, said police asked the men to leave three times but they refused. They were then arrested, but later released after the company elected not to prosecute. He said the officers “did absolutely nothing wrong” and were professional in their conduct toward the two men but “got the opposite back.” He did not mention the man who said he was meeting with the other two men.

“As an African American male, I am very aware of implicit bias; we are committed to fair and unbiased policing,” Ross said. But, he added, “If a business calls and they say that ‘someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business,’ [officers] now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties, and they did just that.”

We apologize to the two individuals and our customers for what took place at our Philadelphia store on Thursday. pic.twitter.com/suUsytXHks — Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) April 14, 2018

Starbucks posted an apology on Twitter on Saturday, saying the company was “disappointed this led to an arrest” and was reviewing its policies.

“We take these matters seriously and clearly have more work to do when it comes to how we handle incidents in our store,” the company said in a statement Saturday afternoon.

Later Saturday, Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said that the company had launched an investigation into what he called “a disheartening situation.”

“Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome — the basis for the call to the Philadelphia Police Department was wrong,” Johnson said in a statement. “Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.”

He said that Starbucks planned to further train employees “to better know when police assistance is warranted” and would hold a company-wide meeting in the coming week to discuss next steps. Johnson also said that he hoped to meet with the two men and apologize personally.

Ross said he doesn’t patronize Starbucks but recalled an incident from a few years ago in which a uniformed sergeant was denied access to a Starbucks bathroom, “so they are at least consistent in their policy.”

Mayor Jim Kenney said he asked the city Commission on Human Relations to examine the company’s policies and procedures, “including the extent of, or need for, implicit bias training for its employees.”

“I am heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines for an incident that — at least based on what we know at this point — appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018,” Kenney said in a statement.

Kenney said a review promised by police of policies in similar situations “is fully warranted given the unfortunate outcome of this event, particularly at a time when our criminal justice reform efforts are focused on avoiding needless incarcerations.”

Attorney Lauren Wimmer told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the men, whom she did not identify, are commercial real estate professionals and were meeting with the another man to discuss business. She identified herself as a friend of the man they were meeting with.

A spokesman for the district attorney’s office said the two black men were released “because of lack of evidence” that a crime had been committed, but declined further comment, citing a police investigation.

“Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome — the basis for the call to the Philadelphia Police Department was wrong,” Johnson said in a statement. “Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.”

He said that Starbucks planned to further train employees “to better know when police assistance is warranted” and would hold a company-wide meeting in the coming week to discuss next steps. Johnson also said that he hoped to meet with the two men and apologize personally.

Ross said he doesn’t patronize Starbucks but recalled an incident from a few years ago in which a uniformed sergeant was denied access to a Starbucks bathroom, “so they are at least consistent in their policy.”

Mayor Jim Kenney said he asked the city Commission on Human Relations to examine the company’s policies and procedures, “including the extent of, or need for, implicit bias training for its employees.”

“I am heartbroken to see Philadelphia in the headlines for an incident that — at least based on what we know at this point — appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018,” Kenney said in a statement.

Kenney said a review promised by police of policies in similar situations “is fully warranted given the unfortunate outcome of this event, particularly at a time when our criminal justice reform efforts are focused on avoiding needless incarcerations.”

Attorney Lauren Wimmer told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the men, whom she did not identify, are commercial real estate professionals and were meeting with the another man to discuss business. She identified herself as a friend of the man they were meeting with.

A spokesman for the district attorney’s office said the two black men were released “because of lack of evidence” that a crime had been committed, but declined further comment, citing a police investigation.

1697.0,"Capping off a week where Senate Democrats embarrassed themselves at what should have been the semi-serious vetting of a Supreme Court justice, along comes our foot-stomping former president to remind Americans of who, ultimately, is responsible for infantilizing national politics.

While lecturing college students assembled in an auditorium in central Illinois—the adopted home state he rarely visits—Barack Obama engaged in the type of vacuous, preening, pretentious, and meaningless soliloquy that once upon a time was accepted as thoughtful political discourse. But it was a temper tantrum disguised as a sermon. He might as well as gone on stage in Champaign and said, “Trump is a big fat meanie!”

Listening to Obama speak is the auditory equivalent of eating cotton candy. It looks sweet and pretty at first, and momentarily it tickles your tongue with the first taste. But it quickly dissolves in your mouth, leaving behind an odd aftertaste. Your hunger isn’t satisfied; you kick yourself for wasting the calories, and you move on to the carnival hot dog. (Yes, these metaphors are intentional.)

Friday’s speech was yet another reminder of why Donald Trump won in 2016: Voters rejected Barack Obama as much as they rejected Hillary Clinton. After a decade of binging on this skilled politician’s oratory cocktail of empty platitudes, self-puffery, and finger-wagging scoldings, we were burned out. Americans started to notice that the soaring rhetoric did not match the accomplishments. There was a creeping sense the same man who once promised his vision was “not red states or blue states, just the United States” had done more damage to the body politic than any other president in recent memory.

And he wasn’t even a good tactician for his own side. In fact, while this political mastermind was in the Oval Office, his party lost more than 1,000 seats to Republicans across the country.

Not an Ounce of Self-Awareness

One might imagine that suffering one political humiliation after another would humble this former community organizer. That handing over the keys to the most powerful office in the world to someone with zero political experience—who questioned your birth certificate and publicly mocked your presumed successor—then systematically disassembled every key achievement of your administration while the economy responded in delight would make you reconsider your approach. Maybe a true statesman would spend two years in exile reexamining what went wrong on his watch and offer a few mea culpas to the political party—and to the country—he helped diminish.

But there is no indication Barack Obama has learned any lessons from 2016. His speech (while he was accepting an ethics award, no less) was a weary remix of Obama’s Greatest Hits. It’s not just that Obama is petulant and demeaning. It’s not that he gets away with the very name-calling and ridicule that Trump gets blasted for.

The bottom line is Obama is a bore. His banality is reflective of the wider Democratic Party malaise. There is no inspiring message or even policy prescription. It’s wholly reliant on tropes about race and class and fear. It’s filled with potshots at the other side while pretending to be above-it-all and morally superior. The chin held high in the air as he speaks is not accidental: Obama is pretending to be just like you, but believes deep down he is far better.

Well-Worn Complaints

Far from the speech being the “greatest, most timely, and most important in the history of this country” as one Democratic activist described it, Obama’s speech sounded like an updated version of every speech he’s given in the past few years. It was filled with whiny platitudes about moments in time and stark choices and inequality and demagogues. He veered between warnings about fake patriotism while insisting it’s our civic duty to vote the way he wants. He pouted about not getting credit for the country’s booming economy. Both sides are culpable for the current political divide, Obama admitted, but Republicans are much more to blame. (Perhaps he missed this week’s spectacle at the Kavanaugh hearings.)

He trotted out the same well-worn complaints about voting rights and climate change. Solutions always come with a price, such as a carbon tax and higher minimum wage. After eight years of trying, he still can’t come up with a convincing sell on how to fix the nation’s failing immigration system: “Democrats talk about reforming our immigration system so, yes, it is orderly and it is fair and it is legal but it continues to welcome strivers and dreamers from all around the world.” Huh?

There were more nuggets of nothingness: A vacuum in democracy. The politics of fear. Stand up to bullies not follow them. We need more women in charge. The best way to protest is to vote. Walls don’t keep out threats like terrorism or disease.

Pretty boring stuff from a guy who is widely considered by the media as one of the greatest presidential orators of all time. It’s doubtful that Chris Matthews felt a thrill up his leg as he listened to this snoozer.

He Goes Low



It wouldn’t be Obama if he didn’t land some low punches at his political foes. This is one of the most overlooked characteristics of the former president: He is as petty and petulant as the current one.

Capitalizing on one of the big news stories of the week, Obama brought up the anonymous op-ed in the New York Times allegedly authored by a senior official in the Trump administration: “The claim that everything will turn out OK because there are people inside the White House who secretly aren’t following the president’s orders, that is not a check. That’s not how our democracy is supposed to work,” Obama said. “They’re not doing us a service by actively promoting ninety percent of the crazy stuff that’s coming out of this White House, and then saying, ‘Don’t worry, we’re preventing the other 10 percent.’”

So much for civil norms about a previous president not criticizing a sitting president.

Obama now is threatening to campaign for Democratic candidates nationwide, an effort that has been snubbed by some incumbents fighting for reelection in states won by Donald Trump. Perhaps those Democrats know something Obama does not. His powers of political persuasion are gone, torched by a Manhattan business man and reality TV star he once publicly taunted never would be president. It looks like Obama, now as always, is the last to know.

When I walk into a Starbucks or a Dunkin Donuts these days, the calorie count on my favorite cruller or apple fritter or frappe glares at me across the aisle, and I frequently choose the lower calorie blueberry crumb with a no sugar latte. But the point is that I don’t choose nothing. The idea that knowing what we are eating is somehow bad for business is unproven at best, destructive at worst.

Do you want to know how many calories are in your hamburger or pizza or even salad? I do. Consider that we Americans eat and drink one third of all our calories away from home, and this is frequently where we get into the most trouble, especially at fast food chains or pizza joints.

A year ago, the Food and Drug Administration, under new leader Scott Gottlieb, delayed implementation for a year of the so-called Menu Labeling rule of the Affordable Care Act. The rule requires that 20 or more locations operating under the same brand offer comprehensive nutrition information to consumers and display easily-seen calorie counts. where they can make a difference in terms of customer choice.

The FDA has now decided to take the brakes off and the new rule will go into effect Monday.

More:Can Amazon help us shrink health care bureaucracy? As a doctor I hope so.

This could have a big impact on public health, though predictably, not everyone is happy. Some pizza chains in particular are complaining that the cost of implementing these changes is too high especially when there are so many toppings per pizza, delivery menus to consider, and pizza makers are concerned about consequences if they fail to comply.

They are wrong. The FDA intends to suggest easy-to-use low-cost menus with a range of calories to fit varying toppings, and strict enforcement is not envisioned. Many chains are already compliant. And if you get an extra piece of cheese on your cheeseburger, no one will be punished for it.

Pizza is a big part of the American diet. Overall, 13% of the U.S. population over the age of 2 consumes pizza on any given day.

But the problem goes well beyond just pizza. About 40% of U.S. adults are obese, which increases risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke and some cancers.

Gottlieb told me in a recent interview I did with him for Fox News that he believes menu labeling is part of the proper treatment of the problem. “Data show that if you have information on menu labels, the average consumer will reduce their caloric intake but 30 to 40 calories a day. And that turns out to be about three to five pounds a year that you can lose by just having better information,” he said.

People become obese in the first place by eating 64 calories incrementally per day, Gottlieb added — so if you can reduce caloric intake by this amount, you are “a long way toward reducing the caloric intake enough to actually affect obesity rates in this country.”

I questioned the FDA commissioner on his views that menu labeling is actually pro business. “It’s pro competition,” he said, “because restaurants are going to probably reformulate their foods in ways to make them more healthful. Certain consumers are going to want low-calorie options. You know some consumers are still going to opt for the high calorie option — but they’ll know what they’re getting.”

Gottlieb is right, both from the point of view of the public right to know, as well as the need for a future where businesses compete to make us healthier rather than sicker. More and more we are studying the health effects of food on our bodies. Food is a medicine. Food keeps us well, but it can also make us sick. Gottlieb helps us to remember why the word food comes before the word drug in the name of the FDA.

1869.0,"In the mid-1990s, a young reporter at the entertainment trade magazine Variety pitched a story at the weekly meeting that would’ve made Harvey Weinstein look bad.

The pitch centered around the dangers of smaller movie companies moving into the production realm, and the reporter wanted to use Weinstein’s company, Miramax, as the prime example, since a number of its early forays into production had been less than successful.

But Peter Bart, the magazine’s powerful editor-in-chief, wasn’t impressed.

“Peter Bart shut that story down instantly, raised his voice and basically made sure that not only was that story not happening, but that I would never suggest anything similar again,” said the reporter ― who, like others interviewed by HuffPost for this story, didn’t want to be named because he still works “in the industry.”

Some of the reporter’s other stories were also killed during his time at Variety, but for “the usual editorial reasons,” the reporter recalled. “That was the only time a story was rejected out of hand for no apparent reason other than the company it was about,” he said.

When everyone left the room, a colleague let the reporter in on one of the magazine’s unofficial policies. “We don’t do those kinds of stories about Miramax,” he recalled the colleague saying.

That sentiment was well-known at Variety, which was then one of the most highly influential institutions in Hollywood, another former Variety employee said. “You’d never find a critical piece about Harvey or about his company, which at the time was Miramax, in the paper. You just wouldn’t,” according to the employee. “It almost became the unspoken rule.”

The New York Times’ and New Yorker’s explosive investigations into Weinstein’s alleged sexual harassment and assault have spurred dozens of women to come forward with their own stories about Weinstein’s predation. So far, at least 35 women have accused Weinstein of rape, assault or sexual harassment.

The exposure of Hollywood’s most open of open secrets has led Weinstein’s accusers ― as well as their loved ones, journalists and those working in the industry ― to ask why, exactly, entertainment journalists preferred to cozy up to Weinstein instead of investigate him.

Part of the answer is that Weinstein was a master of manipulating the press ― sometimes strong-arming journalists and other times cajoling them, but either way bringing them into his field of influence.

Evidence of this could be seen even in the otherwise antagonistic coverage of Weinstein’s downfall, which treated the producer as the second coming of Sam Goldwyn. In truth, he was a better marketer of movies than a maker of them, and to elide the difference, he needed the help of journalists.

Bart, who at his height was one of the most powerful chroniclers of the film industry, was an eager and useful co-conspirator. Interviews with former reporters and editors at Variety describe him as one of Weinstein’s greatest protectors ― exactly the sort of enabler who helped to keep Weinstein’s “open secret” a secret for so long.

You’d never find a critical piece about Harvey or about his company, which at the time was Miramax, in the paper. You just wouldn’t. Former Variety employee

In 1989, Weinstein’s Miramax brought the film “Sex, Lies, and Videotape” to the Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d’Or, the festival’s top honor. The moment helped Weinstein and his brother, Bob, burst onto the national scene ― two brash independent studio heads with a willingness to put out films other people weren’t, often to widespread acclaim.

That same year, Bart became the editor of Weekly Variety, and his career was intertwined with Weinstein’s from then on. Before his time at Variety, Bart had been a player in Hollywood’s golden age, helping to produce pictures like “Rosemary’s Baby” and “The Godfather.” He considered himself more a “statesman” of Hollywood than another lowly scribbler, as one former Variety editor explained.

Bart pushed to expand the publication’s footprint, transforming what had been a stodgy magazine into an influential powerhouse as he rose to the top of the masthead. Under his reign, page count increased, as did staff head count. Special sections that celebrated industry milestones (and of course, awards season), went from incidental to ubiquitous. “Everything was more,” explained Kinsey Lowe, a former news editor, who began at Variety in 1988 before Bart took over.

By the mid-1990s, Weinstein was one of the hottest names in Hollywood, and Bart was as tapped into the going-ons of the industry as anyone else. The powerful pair became close, developing a mutually beneficial relationship. Few publications gained more from Weinstein’s trick of turning an Oscar race into something like a sporting event. He provided Variety with loads of good copy during awards season, not to mention tons of ad revenue from Miramax and the bigger studios that wanted to keep up. “Chocolat” got a best picture nomination, and Variety got to boost its bottom line.

“He became the best friend of every media company,” said one veteran Hollywood insider of Weinstein, adding that there was a time when it was impossible to sift through an issue of Variety without being overwhelmed with Miramax advertisements.

In 1997, Michael Evans, the New York advertising sales director for the magazine, told The New York Times that Miramax had purchased about 40 percent of all Oscar ads in Variety’s weekly edition. “That was a huge source of income for Variety, and Variety of course needed the money,” said one employee. Two years later, while pushing the films “Life Is Beautiful” and “Shakespeare In Love” ― the latter of which eventually won the Oscar for best picture ― Miramax’s aggressive marketing changed the way Oscar campaigns were run.

“They spent $3 million on the trades,” DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg said at the time with some astonishment, before adding that his studio had been forced to increase its marketing budget in turn to keep up.

One former Variety staffer said Bart’s focus was on sales. “Ultimately, that’s what he cared about,” the staffer said. “He loved to buddy up to people. In particular with Harvey. It was about not upsetting one of his major advertisers.”

But not everyone agreed that advertising concerns caused Bart to treat Weinstein in any particular way. “Look, Miramax was a big client of ours, but they weren’t our biggest,” said former Variety publisher Charlie Koones, who ascribed the fat revenues of the 1990s to Bart’s editorial decisions.

Whatever the case, the end result was an editorial product that left many employees working under Bart feeling journalistically compromised. “If you look at the business end of it, Peter Bart was very good for Variety. But in terms of, for the news value, I don’t know about that,” said Lowe, the former news editor. “There was never anything bad said about Harvey Weinstein.”

[Bart] loved to buddy up to people. In particular with Harvey. It was about not upsetting one of his major advertisers. Former Variety staffer

In his own journalism, which was famously blunt and conversational, Bart was often quick to boost Weinstein. At the beginning of Oscar season in 1999, which Bart described as “Harvey Time,” he celebrated Weinstein’s ability to pull “rabbits out of his hat as rivals gnash their teeth and Oscar statuettes begin their inexorable march toward the Halls of Miramax.” Bart depicted Weinstein as a rebel with a cause (“And with a certain triumphant air, he lit another cigarette,” he once wrote of the producer) and applauded him when he criticized the use of “anonymous sources” in Premiere Magazine.

Bart stood up for Weinstein’s controversial Oscar win for “Shakespeare In Love.” And he was ready to play Weinstein’s hype man after a down year for Miramax. “Ever the steely realist, Harvey knows full well that last year’s hat trick cannot be repeated, and that the media can easily turn from worshipful to wicked,” Bart wrote in 1996.

“Peter was enamored with Harvey,” recalled Leonard Klady, a former Variety reporter, in an interview with HuffPost.

Klady said that Bart never explicitly told him how to cover Miramax. Rex Weiner, a Los Angeles-based journalist and former Variety reporter who covered the indie film industry, said the same.

But, Weiner added, that didn’t mean employees didn’t know when to tiptoe. “It was not unknown at Variety that [Bart] had his friends in the business, and you had to be careful reporting on them,” Weiner said. “And conversely, he would say, ‘Go after somebody.’”

Other former Variety employees went further. One said that Bart would pull people off the Miramax beat if the coverage was too harsh. “He definitely was doing Harvey favors,” said the employee. “All the coverage was just golden.”

Another said that publicists would threaten reporters looking into negative stories about Miramax by saying, “All right, well Harvey’s just going to call Peter then.”

“And ultimately, you knew that was true, too, so you were neutered as a reporter right off the bat,” the former editor added.

Said a third former Variety staffer: “He had certain sacred cows, and one of them was Harvey Weinstein.” After a while, they said, reporters just learned to self-censor on the subject of Weinstein. When they didn’t, Bart just tweaked the stories to his liking.

“Writers and editors privately complained that he would sometimes rewrite or soften their stories, especially if the article were critical of his closest business friends, which included Miramax Films co-founder Harvey Weinstein,” the Los Angeles Times wrote of Bart in 2009.

Bart let Weinstein and other favorite sources “vet stories that mentioned them, letting them make adjustments,” according to Los Angeles Magazine. The relationship was so cozy that Weinstein requested Bart’s presence at a Variety interview even though Bart wasn’t the one conducting it. One day before the New Yorker posted its investigation into Weinstein’s transgressions, former Variety columnist Anne Thompson detailed the odd arrangement in a column.

“When I went to Cannes as a Variety columnist and tried to set up a feature interview with Harvey on the Weinsteins’ slate, he insisted that Variety editor Peter Bart and his lieutenant Tim [Gray] be present to make sure the publication took care of him,” she wrote.

The feeling was much the same on the Miramax side. One publicist who did work for Miramax told HuffPost that Bart “was very much in the court.” Bart was what was considered a “FOH,” or “Friend of Harvey,” the publicist said.

“Peter thought he was a kingmaker,” a former Variety editor said. “He thought he was like one of these moguls. He talked about himself that way. He would boast about being with them, hanging out with them, being shown an early cut of a movie ― stuff like that.”

Over time, the transactional nature of Bart and Weinstein’s relationship became plain to see, even in the pages of Variety itself. In 1997, they hosted a cocktail party together to celebrate Fifty Years of Sun, Sex & Celluloid, a book about the Cannes Film Festival written by Bart and his Variety editors for Weinstein’s Miramax Books.

“The book was going to be called ‘Fifty Years of Sun & Celluloid,’ but I decided to insert the word sex into the title,” Weinstein joked at the party, according to an item written in Bart’s magazine.

Two years later, on the 10th anniversary of Bart taking over Variety, Weinstein threw him a party to commemorate his decade in charge of the magazine.

Koones, the former Variety publisher, denied that Bart played favorites. “I got studio heads calling me to bitch about him all the time,” he told HuffPost.

Did that include Weinstein?

“Oh, I think so. I think so. I don’t remember specifically,” Koones said. “You know, I think Harvey bitched about Peter’s coverage on occasion, sure. I think that the notion that Peter was in anybody’s back pocket is bullshit. I was there. It didn’t happen. It just didn’t happen. People have been saying that for years and years.”

“Look, I understand. Did Harvey throw a party for Peter? Yeah, he did,” Koones added. “And you know, if I was a reporter, I’d probably ask the same question.”

In September 2001, Amy Wallace published a devastating profile of Bart in Los Angeles Magazine. It was titled “Is Peter Bart the Most Hated Man in Hollywood?”

The profile begins with a paranoid Bart on the phone with Wallace, threatening to sue. She proceeds to depict him as racist and anti-Semitic, as well as a possible fabulist and serial liar. “If a reporter or an editor at a major daily newspaper [flouted] the basic rules of journalism the way Bart does, they’d be shown the door,” Wallace wrote.

Wallace also detailed Bart’s conflicts of interest within the industry for the first time, reporting that he seemed to have shopped a script ― she had the script ― and was known to let people like Weinstein tweak stories before they were published: “When confronted by the reporters whose bylines topped the altered stories, Bart would say he got better information after deadline. ‘This is my paper,’ one remembers him saying. ‘I’ll do as I please.’”

Wallace’s story earned Bart a 21-day suspension and led the owners of Variety to launch an investigation into the article’s allegations with the help of outside counsel. Ultimately, the investigators said they “found no evidence that Peter abused his power or influence as editor,” and he was allowed to return as editor-in-chief. Two years later, Miramax published Bart’s book Dangerous Company, and Variety threw a party for the Weinstein brothers.

To mark its 100th anniversary in 2005, Variety invited Harvey Weinstein to talk about what he thought of the trade publication. “In terms of quality entertainment trade magazines, Variety is the best,” Weinstein said. “I think there is something to be said by the fact that entertainment insiders as well as people outside the industry keep up with their entertainment news on a daily basis by reading Variety. The reporters do a great job researching the facts for their news stories and the columnists have very interesting perspectives and insights into the business.”

Miramax was again boosting Bart’s wallet in 2006, when it published another of his splashy Hollywood books. After Bart finally stepped down as Variety editor-in-chief in 2009, he again contracted with Weinstein to write another book. He called it Infamous Players.

Even in his emeritus years, Bart could be counted on to defend Weinstein’s honor. In 2013, he wrote a column lambasting Oscars host Seth MacFarlane for joking that the five best supporting actress nominees would “no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.” (MacFarlane recently explained that the joke “came from a place of loathing and anger” after his friend told him about unwanted advances from Weinstein.)

In an email to HuffPost, Bart called the charge that he had ever banned negative stories about Weinstein “ridiculous.”

“Anyone checking Variety could find an abundance of negative pieces on Miramax,” he wrote. Reading through Variety’s archives, the coverage appeared overwhelmingly positive. When we asked Bart for critical stories he was most proud of, he said he didn’t have time to cooperate fully. “I have meetings and screenings tomorrow and I won’t be able to do this intelligently,” he responded. “Besides which I don’t see a need to defend myself against anonymous critics.”

Bart also suggested that he hadn’t written for Miramax during his time at Variety. (He had.)

“As for books, my books were published by Simon & Schuster, Putnam, St Martins, Linden Press, etc long before Miramax asked to publish Infamous Players, by which time I was no longer editor in chief,” Bart wrote.

In a phone interview, Bart said he had “never received whistleblowers’ comments” about Weinstein’s sexual transgressions. “Wish I had,” he added.

Instead, Bart said that he and his reporters had heard about “business issues” involving the mogul, like “directors who felt that he intruded upon the final cut.”

So nothing about sexual assault?

“No, I never got that,” Bart said. “Had I, we would have run it.”

Do not provide anything else other than generated questions separaterd by commas. Document: In the mid-1990s, a young reporter at the entertainment trade magazine Variety pitched a story at the weekly meeting that would’ve made Harvey Weinstein look bad.

The pitch centered around the dangers of smaller movie companies moving into the production realm, and the reporter wanted to use Weinstein’s company, Miramax, as the prime example, since a number of its early forays into production had been less than successful.

But Peter Bart, the magazine’s powerful editor-in-chief, wasn’t impressed.

“Peter Bart shut that story down instantly, raised his voice and basically made sure that not only was that story not happening, but that I would never suggest anything similar again,” said the reporter ― who, like others interviewed by HuffPost for this story, didn’t want to be named because he still works “in the industry.”

Some of the reporter’s other stories were also killed during his time at Variety, but for “the usual editorial reasons,” the reporter recalled. “That was the only time a story was rejected out of hand for no apparent reason other than the company it was about,” he said.

When everyone left the room, a colleague let the reporter in on one of the magazine’s unofficial policies. “We don’t do those kinds of stories about Miramax,” he recalled the colleague saying.

That sentiment was well-known at Variety, which was then one of the most highly influential institutions in Hollywood, another former Variety employee said. “You’d never find a critical piece about Harvey or about his company, which at the time was Miramax, in the paper. You just wouldn’t,” according to the employee. “It almost became the unspoken rule.”

The New York Times’ and New Yorker’s explosive investigations into Weinstein’s alleged sexual harassment and assault have spurred dozens of women to come forward with their own stories about Weinstein’s predation. So far, at least 35 women have accused Weinstein of rape, assault or sexual harassment.

The exposure of Hollywood’s most open of open secrets has led Weinstein’s accusers ― as well as their loved ones, journalists and those working in the industry ― to ask why, exactly, entertainment journalists preferred to cozy up to Weinstein instead of investigate him.

Part of the answer is that Weinstein was a master of manipulating the press ― sometimes strong-arming journalists and other times cajoling them, but either way bringing them into his field of influence.

Evidence of this could be seen even in the otherwise antagonistic coverage of Weinstein’s downfall, which treated the producer as the second coming of Sam Goldwyn. In truth, he was a better marketer of movies than a maker of them, and to elide the difference, he needed the help of journalists.

Bart, who at his height was one of the most powerful chroniclers of the film industry, was an eager and useful co-conspirator. Interviews with former reporters and editors at Variety describe him as one of Weinstein’s greatest protectors ― exactly the sort of enabler who helped to keep Weinstein’s “open secret” a secret for so long.

You’d never find a critical piece about Harvey or about his company, which at the time was Miramax, in the paper. You just wouldn’t. Former Variety employee

In 1989, Weinstein’s Miramax brought the film “Sex, Lies, and Videotape” to the Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d’Or, the festival’s top honor. The moment helped Weinstein and his brother, Bob, burst onto the national scene ― two brash independent studio heads with a willingness to put out films other people weren’t, often to widespread acclaim.

That same year, Bart became the editor of Weekly Variety, and his career was intertwined with Weinstein’s from then on. Before his time at Variety, Bart had been a player in Hollywood’s golden age, helping to produce pictures like “Rosemary’s Baby” and “The Godfather.” He considered himself more a “statesman” of Hollywood than another lowly scribbler, as one former Variety editor explained.

Bart pushed to expand the publication’s footprint, transforming what had been a stodgy magazine into an influential powerhouse as he rose to the top of the masthead. Under his reign, page count increased, as did staff head count. Special sections that celebrated industry milestones (and of course, awards season), went from incidental to ubiquitous. “Everything was more,” explained Kinsey Lowe, a former news editor, who began at Variety in 1988 before Bart took over.

By the mid-1990s, Weinstein was one of the hottest names in Hollywood, and Bart was as tapped into the going-ons of the industry as anyone else. The powerful pair became close, developing a mutually beneficial relationship. Few publications gained more from Weinstein’s trick of turning an Oscar race into something like a sporting event. He provided Variety with loads of good copy during awards season, not to mention tons of ad revenue from Miramax and the bigger studios that wanted to keep up. “Chocolat” got a best picture nomination, and Variety got to boost its bottom line.

“He became the best friend of every media company,” said one veteran Hollywood insider of Weinstein, adding that there was a time when it was impossible to sift through an issue of Variety without being overwhelmed with Miramax advertisements.

In 1997, Michael Evans, the New York advertising sales director for the magazine, told The New York Times that Miramax had purchased about 40 percent of all Oscar ads in Variety’s weekly edition. “That was a huge source of income for Variety, and Variety of course needed the money,” said one employee. Two years later, while pushing the films “Life Is Beautiful” and “Shakespeare In Love” ― the latter of which eventually won the Oscar for best picture ― Miramax’s aggressive marketing changed the way Oscar campaigns were run.

“They spent $3 million on the trades,” DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg said at the time with some astonishment, before adding that his studio had been forced to increase its marketing budget in turn to keep up.

One former Variety staffer said Bart’s focus was on sales. “Ultimately, that’s what he cared about,” the staffer said. “He loved to buddy up to people. In particular with Harvey. It was about not upsetting one of his major advertisers.”

But not everyone agreed that advertising concerns caused Bart to treat Weinstein in any particular way. “Look, Miramax was a big client of ours, but they weren’t our biggest,” said former Variety publisher Charlie Koones, who ascribed the fat revenues of the 1990s to Bart’s editorial decisions.

Whatever the case, the end result was an editorial product that left many employees working under Bart feeling journalistically compromised. “If you look at the business end of it, Peter Bart was very good for Variety. But in terms of, for the news value, I don’t know about that,” said Lowe, the former news editor. “There was never anything bad said about Harvey Weinstein.”

The coronavirus outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, in December has sparked fear and anxiety around the world.

The pneumonialike virus has infected more than 78,000 people and killed 1,875. So far, the virus appears to be more contagious but less deadly than SARS. Whereas the latter had a mortality rate of 9.6%, only 2.3% of people infected with the new coronavirus have died. (The number of people infected and the death toll have surpassed the SARS outbreak's eight-month total, however.)

According to Chinese officials, 7,862 patients with coronavirus have made full recoveries since the outbreak began.

Most of those who've died, meanwhile, were elderly or had other ailments that compromised their immune systems. About 80% of patients have experienced mild symptoms, according to new report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that looked at 72,314 cases. It's the largest analysis released so far.

""Among confirmed cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and considered mild (80.9%),"" the report said.

Given this information, some public-health experts say that for the most part, panic over the coronavirus among those outside of China is unproductive and unwarranted. Amira Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University, told Business Insider that excess fear could even cause negative social impacts.

""There's the spread of infectious disease, then there's the spread of panic,"" Roess said. ""They have very different mechanisms.""

In the early stages of an infectious-disease outbreak, Roess added, much of the panic is ""fear of the unknown.""

Still, experts recommend the public take precautions to avoid getting sick, but the most effective measures are everyday actions like increased handwashing and not touching your face.

The spread of disease and the spread of fear

Psychological research shows novel threats raise anxiety levels more than familiar threats, and people tend to underreact to familiar threats.

For example, there's about a one-in-seven chance that heart disease will be the cause of an American's death, whereas the chance they will die at the hands of a foreign-born terrorist is one in 45,808. But according to a 2016 Chapman University survey of American fears, ""terrorist attack on nation"" and ""victim of terrorism"" both ranked among the respondents' top five worries.

This dynamic played out in countries outside of Africa during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa from 2014 to 2016, according to Paul Slovic, a psychologist and the president of the nonprofit Decision Research.

""What happened was quite consistent with what we know about risk perception,"" Slovic wrote in an article for the American Psychology Association. ""The minute the Ebola threat was communicated, it hit all of the hot buttons: It can be fatal, it's invisible and hard to protect against, exposure is involuntary, and it's not clear that the authorities are in control of the situation.""

Past outbreaks of Ebola, however, had much higher death rates than both SARS and the new coronavirus: 25 to 90%. Worldwide, Ebola has killed more than 33,000 people since 1976.

Racist consequences of panic

Nationals of Asian descent in France, Canada, and the US have reported incidents of racism because of public fears of the Wuhan coronavirus.

Nearly 9,000 parents near Toronto signed a petition to prevent students who had traveled to China in the past 17 days from attending school, The Guardian reported.

""This has to stop. Stop eating wild animals and then infecting everyone around you,"" one petition signer wrote. ""Stop the spread and quarantine yourselves or go back.""

According to The New York Times, businesses throughout Hong Kong, South Korea, and Vietnam have posted signs telling customers from mainland China they are not welcome.

Asian students at Arizona State University, meanwhile — where a US case of coronavirus was confirmed — said they were facing jokes, stares, and isolation on campus.

""I cough in class and everybody looks at me,"" a Vietnamese American freshman at ASU told Business Insider's Bryan Pietsch.

Misinformation about the coronavirus has spread as well — no, oregano oil will not cure it, nor will drinking bleach.

Reasons for hope during this coronavirus outbreak

Experts say a few factors should ease global fears about the coronavirus: First, it was identified and determined to be a new virus more quickly than ever before. A week after it was discovered, Chinese authorities had already sequenced the virus and shared it with labs around the world.

""Something that's remarkable here is that within a week, the RNA sequences of the virus are available on the internet, and many can look at it and begin to understand it,"" Richard Martinello, an associate professor of infectious disease at the Yale School of Medicine, told Business Insider. ""That's something that's never been done before.""

Second, a variety of advancements in medical technology since coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s have allowed clinical labs and virologists to conduct more in-depth research into the way zoonotic viruses work.

For example, though scientists already knew coronaviruses could infect humans because they're a cause of the common cold, the SARS outbreak marked the first time a coronavirus was traced back to animals. (It's possible, however, that coronaviruses from animals have made people sick in the past, Martinello said.)

Martinello also said that for people in the US, the seasonal flu poses a much higher risk. At least 19 million Americans contracted the flu in the last four months and 10,000 have died since October.

The preventative measures for both the flu and the coronavirus are the same: handwashing, avoiding face touching, and steering clear of contact with anyone who's sick.

However, the familiarity of the seasonal flu means the general public usually underreacts to its threat. Martinello said he hopes the widespread worry about the coronavirus could lead to lower rates of seasonal flu this year as people take better precautions.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

It's the largest analysis released so far.

""Among confirmed cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and considered mild (80.9%),"" the report said.

Given this information, some public-health experts say that for the most part, panic over the coronavirus among those outside of China is unproductive and unwarranted. Amira Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University, told Business Insider that excess fear could even cause negative social impacts.

""There's the spread of infectious disease, then there's the spread of panic,"" Roess said. ""They have very different mechanisms.""

In the early stages of an infectious-disease outbreak, Roess added, much of the panic is ""fear of the unknown.""

Still, experts recommend the public take precautions to avoid getting sick, but the most effective measures are everyday actions like increased handwashing and not touching your face.

The spread of disease and the spread of fear

Psychological research shows novel threats raise anxiety levels more than familiar threats, and people tend to underreact to familiar threats.

For example, there's about a one-in-seven chance that heart disease will be the cause of an American's death, whereas the chance they will die at the hands of a foreign-born terrorist is one in 45,808. But according to a 2016 Chapman University survey of American fears, ""terrorist attack on nation"" and ""victim of terrorism"" both ranked among the respondents' top five worries.

This dynamic played out in countries outside of Africa during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa from 2014 to 2016, according to Paul Slovic, a psychologist and the president of the nonprofit Decision Research.

""What happened was quite consistent with what we know about risk perception,"" Slovic wrote in an article for the American Psychology Association. ""The minute the Ebola threat was communicated, it hit all of the hot buttons: It can be fatal, it's invisible and hard to protect against, exposure is involuntary, and it's not clear that the authorities are in control of the situation.""

Past outbreaks of Ebola, however, had much higher death rates than both SARS and the new coronavirus: 25 to 90%. Worldwide, Ebola has killed more than 33,000 people since 1976.

Racist consequences of panic

Nationals of Asian descent in France, Canada, and the US have reported incidents of racism because of public fears of the Wuhan coronavirus.

Nearly 9,000 parents near Toronto signed a petition to prevent students who had traveled to China in the past 17 days from attending school, The Guardian reported.

""This has to stop. Stop eating wild animals and then infecting everyone around you,"" one petition signer wrote. ""Stop the spread and quarantine yourselves or go back.""

According to The New York Times, businesses throughout Hong Kong, South Korea, and Vietnam have posted signs telling customers from mainland China they are not welcome.

Asian students at Arizona State University, meanwhile — where a US case of coronavirus was confirmed — said they were facing jokes, stares, and isolation on campus.

""I cough in class and everybody looks at me,"" a Vietnamese American freshman at ASU told Business Insider's Bryan Pietsch.

Misinformation about the coronavirus has spread as well — no, oregano oil will not cure it, nor will drinking bleach.

Reasons for hope during this coronavirus outbreak

Experts say a few factors should ease global fears about the coronavirus: First, it was identified and determined to be a new virus more quickly than ever before. A week after it was discovered, Chinese authorities had already sequenced the virus and shared it with labs around the world.

""Something that's remarkable here is that within a week, the RNA sequences of the virus are available on the internet, and many can look at it and begin to understand it,"" Richard Martinello, an associate professor of infectious disease at the Yale School of Medicine, told Business Insider. ""That's something that's never been done before.""

Second, a variety of advancements in medical technology since coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s have allowed clinical labs and virologists to conduct more in-depth research into the way zoonotic viruses work.

For example, though scientists already knew coronaviruses could infect humans because they're a cause of the common cold, the SARS outbreak marked the first time a coronavirus was traced back to animals. (It's possible, however, that coronaviruses from animals have made people sick in the past, Martinello said.)

Martinello also said that for people in the US, the seasonal flu poses a much higher risk. At least 19 million Americans contracted the flu in the last four months and 10,000 have died since October.

The preventative measures for both the flu and the coronavirus are the same: handwashing, avoiding face touching, and steering clear of contact with anyone who's sick.

However, the familiarity of the seasonal flu means the general public usually underreacts to its threat. Martinello said he hopes the widespread worry about the coronavirus could lead to lower rates of seasonal flu this year as people take better precautions. Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"
1903.0,"The Left’s false narrative about hate privileges partisanship over principle.

This week President Trump signed an executive order expanding the protections afforded to Jews by Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It’s no surprise that some in the mainstream media got the story wrong.

The New York Times’s Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman called the order an attempt at “effectively interpreting Judaism as a race or nationality,” and claimed it was meant to distract the country from Trump’s own alleged anti-Semitism and silence criticism of the State of Israel. Those criticisms were echoed by another report from CNN. Along the same lines, still others claimed that the president was suppressing the free speech of principled critics of Israeli policy.

The notion that Trump was trying to redefine Judaism is just nonsense. As Mark Joseph Stern, no fan of the president, pointed out in Slate, Trump’s order was in line with past decisions by George W. Bush’s Department of Education and Barack Obama’s DOJ to expand the scope of Title VI protections. The original language of Title VI did not extend protection against discrimination based on shared ancestry or religion. That meant that when groups of people were discriminated against because of the “perception of shared race, ethnicity or national origin” — as are Jews as well as Muslims and Sikhs — the law offered them no help. Both the Bush and Obama administrations agreed that was wrong.

The reason why this order is necessary is that although some, such as Senator Bernie Sanders, treat it as an article of faith that anti-Semitism is solely a product of right-wing extremism, left-wing anti-Semitism is on the rise. As is the case in Europe, anti-Semitism often masquerades as anti-Zionism. But as we’ve seen in the last year, supporters of the BDS movement, which seeks to boycott Israel, frequently blur the distinction between legitimate criticism of Israeli government policies and hatred of Jews — and often cross the line entirely, lapsing into classic anti-Semitic tropes. And the federal government has a particular interest in dealing with such hate in higher education, since such institutions rely so heavily on federal funds to operate and are among the primary incubators of the American BDS movement.

Trump’s order urges the government to use the definition of anti-Semitism promoted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which is also the one recognized by the U.S. State Department and many other countries. That definition correctly states that “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor, applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism . . . to characterize Israel or Israelis,” “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis,” and “holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel” are anti-Semitic behaviors. The BDS movement and its leading organization — Students for Justice in Palestine — routinely do all of those things.

Moreover, this effort has long had bipartisan support, as both Democrats such as former Senate majority leader Harry Reid and Republicans sought to remedy the loophole in the law that let campus anti-Semites off the hook. Their efforts failed due to congressional gridlock.

There is nothing new in Trump’s order. But the difference here is that although the Obama administration was on record agreeing in principle to extend Title VI protections to Jews, it chose not to act on the issue, leaving Jewish students vulnerable. Trump’s Department of Education has reversed that policy, calling for investigations into anti-Semitic activity at Rutgers University and ordering the Middle East Studies programs at the University of North Carolina and Duke University to revise curricula that were anti-Semitic. His executive order merely makes that policy shift official.

Efforts to twist Trump’s words or take them out of context as proof of his anti-Semitism resonate with liberals and Democrats. That in this case they aim to discredit what ought to be considered an anodyne measure worthy of bipartisan support, calling it an attack on civil liberties or even a form of anti-Semitism itself, demonstrates just how far Trump’s critics are prepared to go to preserve their false narrative about his promotion of hate.

1921.0,"Washington (CNN) Any way you cut it, President Donald Trump is entitled to significant credit for the historic opening between the two Koreas.

The rush to assign plaudits for the breakthrough that led to a meeting between North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week -- and Trump's own planned summit with Kim -- reflects building hopes that Pyongyang's willingness to talk about dismantling its nuclear arsenal may be genuine.

On Monday, Moon, who was once accused by Trump of appeasing Kim , poured effusive praise on the President.

""President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize. The only thing we need is peace,"" Moon said at a Cabinet meeting.

On Saturday night, Trump's supporters at a rally in Michigan serenaded the President with chants of ""Nobel, Nobel, Nobel"" as he hit out at news organizations he said were not giving him sufficient credit for his strategy of tough rhetoric and strong sanctions designed to bring Kim to the table.

""What do you think President Trump had to do with it? I'll tell you what. Like how about everything? And even President Moon says that and he's been great,"" Trump said.

Whether Trump deserves as much credit as he's claiming or is wise to bullishly declare a new era of denuclearized peace is open to question since many pitfalls still lie ahead.

Still, the summit between Kim and Moon keeps alive the possibility of a legacy win for Trump that would rank as one of the top presidential achievements since World War II.

If he were to preside over the verifiable destruction of the North's nuclear and missile programs, formally end the 1950-53 Korean War and usher in the destruction of the world's last Cold War-era frontier, Trump would claim a feat that has eluded all of his most recent predecessors.

The President and other key players in the initiative would also be shoo-ins for the Nobel Peace Prize as Moon suggests. How Trump would love to join his nemesis Barack Obama on the list of honorees.

Such accolades are years away, and months of treacherous and intricate diplomacy looms if negotiators are to defy grim historical precedent. Every previous diplomatic effort to ease the Korean standoff has foundered on effectively verifying the North's willingness to dismantle its weapons programs -- and its propensity to cheat. There is no sign yet that the Trump administration has solved that fundamental problem -- despite its repeated vows not to make the same mistakes as its predecessors.

But to judge by Trump's reaction, you might think that a final, comprehensive deal with North Korea is already in the bag.

""KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!"" Trump tweeted on Friday.

KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 27, 2018

Despite the uncertain path ahead, Trump took the opportunity Friday to lash out at his predecessors for not solving the North Korea nuclear riddle.

""The United States has been played beautifully, like a fiddle, because you had a different kind of a leader. We're not going to be played, OK?"" he said. ""We're going to hopefully make a deal. If we don't, that's fine. The United States in the past was played like a fiddle.""

Accelerating diplomacy

Trump has not just claimed credit for accelerating diplomacy -- he has even said Moon had told him that without his strong stance, this year's Winter Olympics in South Korea would have been a ""total failure.""

""It's a little hard to sell tickets when you think you're going to be nuked,"" Trump said in March.

Just before Kim and Moon met, the White House on Thursday released pictures of new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's secret meeting with Kim in Pyongyang while he was CIA director.

The intent apparently was to stress the key US role in facilitating Friday's summit.

Trump is not alone in hailing his approach, which saw him fling alarming rhetoric at ""Little Rocket Man"" Kim and boast about the size of his nuclear button, as well as the coining of an intensified strategy of maximum pressure sanctions.

""Clearly, credit goes to President Trump,"" South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in Seoul. ""He's been determined to come to grips with this from Day 1.""

Pompeo said in Brussels that ""we would not be where we are today without President Trump's maximum pressure campaign.""

Trump's wrestle with North Korea's nuclear program dates back to his first meeting with President Barack Obama while he was president-elect. His predecessor told him that Pyongyang's march to tip a ballistic missile that could reach the US with a nuclear warhead would be the burning issue of his presidency.

Trump's policy strategy since has been surprisingly linear and coherent for an administration that has unfolded in a whirl of chaos.

The administration succeeded in enacting the most stringent sanctions regime yet imposed on North Korea -- and crucially got more buy in from China for more pressure on its nominal ally North Korea than ever before.

If those sanctions are indeed behind North Korea's decision to come to the table, Trump's effusive praise of China's President Xi Jinping during a state visit last year, for which he was widely criticized, could be validated.

""Please do not forget the great help that my good friend, President Xi of China, has given to the United States, particularly at the Border of North Korea. Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!"" Trump tweeted on Friday.

Trump's supporters believe that his fierce rhetoric last year, when he vowed to rain ""fire and fury"" on North Korea may also be responsible for unblocking the diplomatic deadlock that has stretched over several administrations.

It's possible that the glimpse into the President's mind did convince China that he may actually be willing to do something unthinkable if it did not get more serious about imposing economic sanctions.

His tirades may also have gotten Kim's attention -- though the North's status as an effective nuclear power following a flurry of nuclear and missile tests may have more to do with the North Korean leader's U-turn -- from a position of strength.

Even before he meets Kim, a note of triumph and finality has crept into Trump's rhetoric -- which may be overly optimistic given the many false thaws between the North and the South -- and the treacherous diplomacy ahead.

Other than holding the Kim-Trump summit, the US diplomatic strategy with North Korea seems opaque.

But the peace deal to replace the Korean War amnesty that the President trumpeted would likely come with a set of conditions from the US side -- including perhaps the export of the North's nuclear arsenal for destruction overseas -- that Kim might find it impossible to accept.

Even the word ""denuclearization"" which Trump has been throwing around in tweets is subject to sharply different interpretations between North Korea and the United States.

Trump's rush to claim credit for the opening also underplays the contribution of other key players.

The South Korean president, for instance, has staked his political career on the events that led up to his historic handshake with Kim on Friday.

And for much of the last year, Kim, with his weapons tests and shock diplomacy, has been dictating events, and leaving Trump to catch up -- as the President did with his surprise agreement to sit down with the North Korean leader himself.

There is only one way to find out whether Kim is truly committed to a new beginning or if he is cycling through the familiar North Korean routine of trading dialogue for concessions and foreign aid while making no realistic steps to freeze or remove nuclear programs.

So Kim's intentions must be tested -- that is one reason why Trump's summit gambit with Kim is defensible.

Given the stakes, and the chance of averting what could be a murderous war on the Korean peninsula, it's possible that even in Washington's divisive political climate, everyone might be rooting for Trump to succeed.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

2044.0,"It’s the world’s most famous interrogation technique, immortalized by countless TV detective shows and backed by the CIA. And now the “good cop, bad cop” routine has begun to pry open the inscrutable Hermit Kingdom.

On Tuesday, the leaders of North and South Korea agreed to sit down next month for historic talks, which may include the denuclearization of the divided peninsular, marking a distinct thaw after years of deteriorating relations amid Pyongyang’s accelerating nuclear and missile tests.

“If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes,” South Korea’s president’s office said Tuesday following a meeting between Seoul officials and Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang, where the group were pictured grinning together during a four-hour dinner.

Much credit for the breakthrough must go to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the son of refugees from the North, who has pushed for dialogue with the Kim regime since his May election, spearheading symbolic cooperation such as marching under a unified flag at the recent Winter Olympics in PyeongChang.

But it would be churlish not to also recognize the contribution of the “bad cop”: U.S. President Donald Trump, who has turned up the heat on North Korea with ever tighter rounds of sanctions, and badgered historic ally China to isolate the 25 million-strong Stalinist state.

“The Trump administration deserves credit for increasing the pressure and deepening even further the alienation between China and North Korea,” says Professor John Delury, an East Asia expert at Yonsei Univeristy in Seoul. “And globally, there have been a lot of bilateral relationships where Trump has put North Korea at the top of the agenda.”

Like in Egypt, whose pilots were trained by North Korea during the 1973 war with Israel, and whose obstinate backing of the Kim regime reportedly contributed to the recent suspension of $290 million of American aid. Or nations like Spain, Italy, Mexico, Peru and Kuwait, which in the last year expelled their North Korean ambassadors following pressure from the White House.

This is important as North Korean embassies abroad operate as revenue-generating hubs for myriad illicit activities. In October, thousands of bottles of bootlegged whisky, beer and wine were stolen from a North Korean diplomat’s home in the Pakistani capital Islamabad. Several African nations with military links to North Korea have also been pressured to cut off ties, which experts say could trim 3-5% off Pyongyang’s foreign currency reserves.

But more crucial has been the extra pressure Trump has put on China to enforce two new rounds of U.N. sanctions. Despite all warnings to the contrary, the Trump administration has also steadfastly maintained that military action remains on the table. Such threats have been roundly — and rightly — criticized as risking nuclear catastrophe, though there’s little doubt Chinese President Xi Jinping has taken notice, especially when Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff General Joseph Dunford visited the border area in August and established three-star communication channels with the Chinese military to avoid accidental clashes in the event of a conflict.

Sanctions enforcement by Beijing is key. About 90% of all North Korean trade comes across the 880-mile shared frontier, but recent Chinese imports of coal, seafood and labor have been slashed. As a result, some experts suggest North Korea may burn through cash reserves by the middle of 2019. Reports of a sudden depreciation of North Korean currency to the Euro will also hamper Kim keeping the North Korean elites satisfied. That North Korea has resorted to inefficient and costly ship-to-ship transfers to evade the sanctions is yet more evidence that they are biting.

Trump’s tightening noose, combined with a sympathetic ear in Seoul (compared to hawkish former President Park Geun-hye), is the most likely explanation for Kim’s stunning about-face. Not only did the Swiss-educated 34-year-old agree to meet Moon at the DMZ that has divided the Korean peninsular since the 1950-53 Korean war, he offered to discuss denuclearization with Washington, and also confirmed that April’s summit would take place regardless of whether U.S.-South Korea military exercises occur in the interim. North Korea traditionally abhors the drills, deeming them a dress rehearsal for invasion, and stages missile and nuclear tests to coincide.

“The drills were one of the biggest issues that was likely to become a poison pill to negotiations,” says Stephan Haggard, a Korea expert at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy. “And that they’re willing to actually discuss the nuclear issue means they’re really desperate to have talks.”

Turning that desperation into a meaningful resolution will be no easy feat, however, and even if an agreement is reached, North Korea’s record of noncompliance is galling. But the thaw is positive given that years of isolation led North Korea’s weapons program to advance in leaps and bounds, with their latest nuclear-armed ballistic missiles theoretically able to hit anywhere on the continental U.S.

Trump, notably, isn’t being too triumphant, tweeting that the summit is “possible progress” but “may be false hope.” That is true. And its also a concern whether Trump’s threadbare State Department has the expertise and wherewithal to exploit this momentous opportunity. But then again, if it proves at all possible, there’s few better placed than “good cop” Moon — a man with deep emotional and intellectual connections to the North — to eke the goods out of Kim.

Document: It’s the world’s most famous interrogation technique, immortalized by countless TV detective shows and backed by the CIA. And now the “good cop, bad cop” routine has begun to pry open the inscrutable Hermit Kingdom.

On Tuesday, the leaders of North and South Korea agreed to sit down next month for historic talks, which may include the denuclearization of the divided peninsular, marking a distinct thaw after years of deteriorating relations amid Pyongyang’s accelerating nuclear and missile tests.

“If military threats to the North Korea decrease and regime safety is guaranteed, the North showed that it has no reason to retain nukes,” South Korea’s president’s office said Tuesday following a meeting between Seoul officials and Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang, where the group were pictured grinning together during a four-hour dinner.

Much credit for the breakthrough must go to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the son of refugees from the North, who has pushed for dialogue with the Kim regime since his May election, spearheading symbolic cooperation such as marching under a unified flag at the recent Winter Olympics in PyeongChang.

But it would be churlish not to also recognize the contribution of the “bad cop”: U.S. President Donald Trump, who has turned up the heat on North Korea with ever tighter rounds of sanctions, and badgered historic ally China to isolate the 25 million-strong Stalinist state.

“The Trump administration deserves credit for increasing the pressure and deepening even further the alienation between China and North Korea,” says Professor John Delury, an East Asia expert at Yonsei Univeristy in Seoul. “And globally, there have been a lot of bilateral relationships where Trump has put North Korea at the top of the agenda.”

Like in Egypt, whose pilots were trained by North Korea during the 1973 war with Israel, and whose obstinate backing of the Kim regime reportedly contributed to the recent suspension of $290 million of American aid. Or nations like Spain, Italy, Mexico, Peru and Kuwait, which in the last year expelled their North Korean ambassadors following pressure from the White House.

This is important as North Korean embassies abroad operate as revenue-generating hubs for myriad illicit activities. In October, thousands of bottles of bootlegged whisky, beer and wine were stolen from a North Korean diplomat’s home in the Pakistani capital Islamabad. Several African nations with military links to North Korea have also been pressured to cut off ties, which experts say could trim 3-5% off Pyongyang’s foreign currency reserves.

But more crucial has been the extra pressure Trump has put on China to enforce two new rounds of U.N. sanctions. Despite all warnings to the contrary, the Trump administration has also steadfastly maintained that military action remains on the table. Such threats have been roundly — and rightly — criticized as risking nuclear catastrophe, though there’s little doubt Chinese President Xi Jinping has taken notice, especially when Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff General Joseph Dunford visited the border area in August and established three-star communication channels with the Chinese military to avoid accidental clashes in the event of a conflict.

2089.0,"I Love You, Daddy is a primer for how conversations about power and consent get muddied and used to excuse abusive behavior. And in the wake of allegations against C.K., the film became unreleasable.

The Orchard Rose Byrne and Louis C.K. in I Love You, Daddy.

Louis C.K.'s I Love You, Daddy was already the world's most terribly timed movie. It's a would-be provocative comedy about how a man's Woody Allen–esque hero starts pursuing his 17-year-old daughter — and was, at the time of writing, still scheduled to open right in the middle of our current maelstrom of stories about decades of Hollywood predation. In the wake of Thursday's New York Times report on C.K.'s own long-rumored sexual misconduct, in which multiple women accuse the comedian of forcing them to watch or listen to him masturbate without their consent, The Orchard announced that it was canceling the release. It's a film, however, that should never have come out at all, unless it was going to be used as a primer for how conversations about power and consent get mishandled, muddied, and ultimately used to excuse or obscure abusive behavior. In the movie, C.K. plays a successful but no-longer-on-his-game television producer named Glen Topher. John Malkovich is Leslie Goodwin, a revered 68-year-old director, unapologetic luster after teenage girls, and rumored child molester. If that doesn't make clear that he's intended to be a Woody Allen stand-in, then the reverence with which C.K.'s character treats him should. ""He's a great artist! Probably the best writer-filmmaker of the last 30 years or more,"" he yelps when his daughter, China (Chloë Grace Moretz), brings up Goodwin's reputed pedophilia and known track record with much younger lovers. Then he scolds her for judging someone on the basis of what she's heard rather than what she can know for sure. ""His private life, that's not anybody's business,"" Glen says, in a variation on a familiar, nauseating rationale that people have used to defend their problematic (right up through potentially criminal) faves for time eternal. It's a rationale C.K. has employed on his own behalf, dismissing talk of his own then-only-rumored misconduct in the New York Times in September by saying, ""If you actually participate in a rumor, you make it bigger and you make it real."" He went on to say, ""The uncomfortable truth is, you never really know. ... To me, if there was one thing this movie is about, it’s that you don’t know anybody.""

The Orchard John Malkovich and Chloë Grace Moretz.

Given those ""rumors"" about C.K. — and the ""rumors"" that also swirled around Weinstein and Brett Ratner and Kevin Spacey and others before victims recently came forward to confirm allegations to the press — the astonishing convenience of this stance is galling. (As is the way the film coyly winks at the stories about C.K. by having a character mime jerking off in a room with his coworkers.) You ""never really know"" only if you're willing to consign accusations of sexual misconduct to the realm of gossip and hearsay, to pretend these stories get whispered about only because no one's sure if they're true, rather than because the consequences of speaking up can be so punitive. As the post-Weinstein fallout consumes Hollywood, spreads through other industries, and provides hope that we may be headed toward actual (maybe) systemic (maybe) change, I Love You, Daddy isn't just tone-deaf. It's stunningly hubristic, pushing an argument that's been used to silence people for decades. And it unfolds entirely within what now feels like a very telling blind spot for its writer, director, and star, in which the answer to questions about consent is inevitably an alarming ""it's complicated.”

I Love You, Daddy is the first movie C.K. has directed since Pootie Tang in 2001. In the years since, he's built up a career as one of the most respected stand-ups in the business; created Louie, an acclaimed, uneven FX show that helped spark a slew of other raw, form-pushing dramedies like Atlanta and Master of None; and self-funded Horace and Pete, an impossible to describe play-as-TV-drama-as-web-series that featured some genuinely great writing and acting. C.K. casts himself in the role of an industry hack in I Love You, Daddy, but as a real-life creator, he's been self-funding his projects in order to make them without outside interference. All of which makes the film more enraging and disappointing, coming after so much work that's grappled with other risky subject matter with empathy and humanity.

I Love You, Daddy is basically ""As the Father of a Daughter"": The Movie.

But he's been dicey on the topics of sexual violence and coercion before. In Season 4 of Louie, his character pushes himself on a resistant Pamela, played by longtime collaborator Pamela Adlon (who also appears in the new movie). During the ensuing struggle she snaps, ""This would be rape if you weren’t so stupid!"" And C.K. has talked about male violence against women in his stand-up, but when he's intentionally portrayed sexual coercion onscreen in the show, he's tended to role-reverse, allowing himself to get forced into oral sex by Melissa Leo or dressed in makeup and penetrated by Adlon. Given that he comes out of these encounters asking to see these women again, these scenes seem more intent on his character's humiliation than on showing any degree of understanding regarding consent. I Love You, Daddy doesn't just continue to muddy the waters around those issues. It is in itself an example of a powerful comedian proving himself incapable of confronting the transgressions of another man in the industry he admires. Which isn't remotely surprising — in the Times article about C.K., estranged collaborator Tig Notaro goes on the record, but none of C.K.'s male colleagues do. Allen's a formative influence for many comedians, and he's clearly one for C.K., who's acted in one of Allen's movies and who includes multiple homages to Allen's Manhattan in I Love You, Daddy. But after raising the possibility of the sexual assault of a child, the film swerves to focus instead on the gray areas surrounding older men who try to sleep with teenage girls. It's a deflection that's crushing, not just because C.K. chooses not to confront the possible misdeeds of another powerful male comedian, but because he opts instead to pick and choose from the rumors, then argue that maybe some of these troubling choices aren't all that bad. To describe this as an unasked-for argument would be putting it lightly. Yet the film makes it nonetheless, by sidelining the rumors of Goodwin’s pedophilia (something that even the noncommittal Glen can't rationalize away) as a “really personal story” Goodwin promises to explain over drinks. As Goodwin is shown grooming China, accompanying her as she tries on bikinis at a department store and taking her to Paris, Glen hovers indecisively, wanting to put a stop to what's happening but unwilling to put his foot down and confront either his doted-on child or the artist he so admires.

The Orchard C.K. as Glen Topher

It's ""As the Father of a Daughter"": The Movie, but C.K. isn't interested in exploring and critiquing the mindset of men whose empathy for women seems entirely dependent on being a parent to one. In lieu of that, he makes a woman, his love interest Grace (Rose Byrne), present talking points about sexual maturity and why what he suspects is happening between Goodwin and his daughter might not be so bad. These are words C.K. clearly feels too uncomfortable having Glen speak; Grace shoulders the unmanageable burden of defending why teenagers should be able to have sex with adults while Glen halfheartedly recites reasons why it's wrong. She's positioned as the sophisticated third-wave feminist actor to his agency-denying rube, whom she scolds for describing the relationship she had as a teenager with a fiftysomething as rape. ""So when a girl does feel lust and desire, then she's got to be with a fucking boy?"" she snaps. It's a conversation the movie presents as reasonable, when it's actually queasy and dangerous. C.K. wants to present sex and attraction as things that are too messy for broad rules or generalizations. But it's impossible to do that if you're also going to willfully ignore or remain oblivious to the central issue — how the massive power imbalance innate to this kind of relationship makes it ripe for abuse, the way power imbalances enabled and protected abuse in all of the stories currently spilling out of Hollywood at the moment. It's Adlon — tasked as she so often is in C.K’s work with being the voice of reason and sanity — who comes in as Glen's salty ex-girlfriend, socks him in the arm, and tells him he has to take action, even if it makes China hate him. In doing so, she provides C.K. with an escape hatch. He's able to turn the movie into one about his character's personal failings, rather than follow through on the incredibly troubling arguments he raises and then runs away from.

The Orchard C.K. and Moretz.

Woody Allen, like the character Leslie Goodwin, was accused but not charged of sexually abusing a child. His alleged victim was his then 7-year-old adopted daughter by then-partner Mia Farrow. Dylan Farrow reiterated the allegations in 2014, mincing no words in calling out those who continue to work with and support Allen, writing that ""Woody Allen is a living testament to the way our society fails the survivors of sexual assault and abuse."" Allen has, of course, continued to work anyway, becoming an enduring symbol of Hollywood’s ability — up to this point — to treat sexual misconduct allegations as a mere inconvenience. He continued to work after marrying another of Mia Farrow's adopted children, a woman who is 35 years his junior, whom he met when he was dating Farrow (a relationship that caused a scandal, but wasn't illegal). The same can be said for the relationship between Allen’s 42-year-old character Isaac Davis and the 17-year-old Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) in Manhattan, traces of which — from the New York City setting to the black-and-white cinematography down to the fact that China is the same age as Tracy — are all over I Love You, Daddy. (Times have changed, but Allen's attempts to normalize these relationships continue with the film he just finished shooting, A Rainy Day in New York, which reportedly features a sexual relationship between characters played by Jude Law, 44, and 19-year-old Elle Fanning.)

Hemingway herself was 18 when Allen tried to whisk her off to Paris the way Goodwin (Malkovich) does with China (Moretz) in I Love You, Daddy. Unlike China, Hemingway chose not to go — in her 2015 memoir, Hemingway described turning him down over uncertainty about the sleeping arrangement, saying, ""I'm not going to get my own room, am I? I can’t go to Paris with you."" Who knows if C.K. was aware of this anecdote when writing I Love You, Daddy (he declined to comment for this piece; C.K. responded to the allegations in the Times story with a written statement in which he says ""These stories are true."") — but it feels like something that could have informed his film, especially in the way Hemingway describes her parents reacting to Allen's offer. ""I wanted them to put their foot down. They didn’t. They kept lightly encouraging me,"" she wrote. C.K.'s insistence, in his own movie, on keeping the focus on parental permissiveness rather than the predatory nature of a decades-older celebrity trying to erode a teenager's boundaries enough to fuck her, serves as its own kind of normalization. And so I Love You, Daddy ends up being a tribute to Allen in ways C.K. probably never intended. ""We’re at the bleeding edge of 'That’s not OK to do now,' but those people are still around,"" he told the Hollywood Reporter. ""That’s a very interesting line to be on."" He doesn't just let Allen off the hook — he lets himself off as well.

C.K. has described I Love You, Daddy, which he shot on the sly this summer, as a film he expected would piss some people off. But in light of C.K.'s alleged past behavior, and the fumbled apologies he reportedly made to some of his victims in the years since, the movie plays more like a stroke of self-immolation. It’s the work of a man who's been expecting consequences to come calling, and who decided to lean into the coming anger with a have-to-hear-all-sides affront that inadvertently echoes so many of the excuses and denials that men adjacent to or accused of misconduct have offered up in the past few weeks.

2113.0,"#MeToo: From Salem to Now

Recognizing the problems inherent in the hysteria surrounding the #MeToo campaign, which the media and politicians are heralding as a pivotal moment in our culture, should not require a difficult intellectual exercise. It was once conventional wisdom gleaned from history. But given that modern media narratives serve more to reshape history than to appropriately understand and learn from it, perhaps a brief history discussion is in order. All you have to do is remember the first famous #MeToo campaign to take place in the Americas. Salem Village, 1692. Young girls, caught up in the frenzied hysteria of rampant devilry and witchcraft as explanations for the problems plaguing Salem Village, led to the accusation of more than 200 men and women of witchery, leading to the execution of 20 innocent people. Today, it is generally believed that these young women and the later accusers voiced their accusations for attention, personal gain, or to capture a moment of relevance in a popular wave of accusations that were then-thought “brave” by local religious leaders, who were both the media criers and political leaders of their day.

Myriad lessons were learned from this horrific event. Chief among these is the realization that there is a distinct problem in weaponizing random accusations of wrongdoing amidst mass hysteria about the rampancy of a peculiar moral evil. That is, innocent men and women are invariably punished when accusations grow from the passions of a frenzied mob. In fact, during this event, Increase Mather, then the president of Harvard, was prompted to make a reasoned observation that what would eventually become a famous cliché: “It were better that ten suspected witches should escape than one innocent person be condemned.” The wisdom of this lesson was later applied by John Adams in his defense of the British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre of 1770. In arguing the innocence of the British soldiers amidst an emotional local populace clamoring for their execution, he was prompted to note that “[F]acts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and reason.” The dichotomy between his approach and that taken the adjudicators in the Salem Witch Trials was not lost on Adams. Years after the Boston Massacre, he said as much. “Judgment of Death against those Soldiers,” he wrote, “would have been as foul a stain upon this Country as the Executions of the Quakers or Witches, anciently.” This all leads to the inevitable question: if facts can damn an American to a horrible fate, either in legal proceedings or in the public square, shouldn’t the absence of damning facts offer the presumption of innocence? This is the point where someone might suggest that testimony is evidence of facts. Of course, in the legal world, testimony which is many years old is often not admissible in a court outside of very specific crimes, and for good reason. We call these protections for defendants “statutes of limitations.” The idea is to ensure that “convictions occur only upon evidence (physical or eyewitness) that has not deteriorated with time.” In the absence of “physical or eyewitness” evidence, personal testimony also has the tendency to diminish with time, due to a prevalent trait in human nature called “recall bias.” You see, our brains are wired to “continually rewrite memories, putting present in the past.” Some studies show that current events can cloud memory, or that some memories might be edited completely, or even that 50% of the memories of a particular event “are completely lost.” If personal testimony is unreliable enough to not alone warrant “fact” immediately after an event, it becomes exponentially unreliable years, even decades, hence. So just imagine the precedent that we accept by allowing that nothing more than personal allegations of sexual assault, harassment, or misconduct is all that is required to discern the facts from allegations in decades-old alleged crimes. We will find ourselves in a world where every future election amounts to Stalin-esque show trials, held by the media to sway public opinion against whatever morally and politically evil candidate they might wish to smear. A world where allegations can ruin a man’s career or marriage absent any of the evidence which would be required to reasonably prove any wrongdoing of any kind. The simple point is that testimony alone is, and should be, insufficient for acceptance as fact. Again, this is not a new lesson. There was ample testimony in Salem regarding the witchery of the accusers’ neighbors, just as there was ample testimony that the British soldiers took an aggressive posture against the colonials in the Boston Massacre. But there’s an important distinction here which has become generally understood by America’s legal system -- however less observed in the court of public opinion. That is, a fact and an allegation are not the same thing. Facts require evidence deemed sufficient to be considered indisputable. An allegation is a claim made in the absence of such evidence, and while an allegation certainly might qualify as testimony, that testimony doesn’t necessarily qualify as evidence of facts. Some just don’t care about these gargantuan distinctions that the legal world tends to recognize. The most obvious example might be modern feminist Emily Lindin, who tweeted that she simply is “not at all concerned about innocent men losing their jobs over false allegations of sexual assault/harassment allegations.” She’s riffing on the generally accepted narrative today, that women with #MeToo tales are to be believed without question, absent the facts needed to condemn a person outside the forum of public opinion. After all, breaking silence, years later, about alleged past incidents of sexual misconduct landed a few high-profile gals on the cover of Time magazine as the “Person of the Year.” The widespread acceptance of these #MeToo allegations and its narrative, without question or reason informing cultural verdicts, is what makes this an atmosphere of a looming, if not entirely underway, witch hunt. Seemingly recognizing this, Fox News host Laura Ingraham offered that conservatives “be wary of the lynch mob that you join today” in response to Al Franken and John Conyers’s resignations, “because tomorrow, it could be coming for your husband, your brother, your son, and yes, even your president.” She’s right. The left has created a narrative in which child molestation, sexual assault, and potential sexual harassment are all equal signs of the presumed cultural phenomenon of predatory behavior toward women. A world where a peculiarly remembered unwanted kiss by a 30-year-old man toward an 18-year-old girl, 40 years ago, can serve as evidence to the veracity of claims that he’s a child molester. It’s not so much that the left hasn’t gleaned the lessons of history around witch hunts, but that the left happens to currently crave the atmosphere of the witch hunt because they believe themselves to be in control the socio-religious pulpit, and they lack the moral integrity of an Increase Mather or a John Adams to call for reason amidst the cultural hysterics. Facts should still be stubborn things, and a dearth of convincing facts should still stubbornly presume innocence. Accused men or women should still be presumed innocent unless it is proven otherwise. If we lose our grasp on those simple principles because we excitedly get caught up in the zephyr of popular outrage against leftist targets of similar accusations, we cede centuries’ worth of costly-to-win ideological ground.

If recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital leads to violence, that’s a rejection of any idea of peace.

The reaction from the foreign-policy establishment and America’s European and Arab allies is unanimous. All are opposed to President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Moreover, the very real possibility of violence from the Palestinians, and perhaps even bloody riots throughout the Muslim world, in reaction to a statement scheduled to be delivered today has once again brought down a hail of criticism assailing the president’s judgment. But while this may complicate America’s position in the Middle East and further confuse an already muddled peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, the brickbats aimed at Trump are ignoring the most significant aspect of the controversy.

Advertisement

If Trump acknowledges something that has been a reality for nearly 70 years — Jerusalem has been Israel’s capital since the conclusion of its War of Independence in 1949 — but, as is likely, doesn’t immediately move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv or explicitly recognize Israel’s right to all of Jerusalem, then any resulting Arab or Muslim violence will make explicit something that most of those opposed to the president usually refuse to acknowledge. The anger about a change in U.S. policy won’t stem from its supposed negative impact on peace negotiations but from a desire to destroy the Jewish state.

The timing of Trump’s statement is curious given the fact that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been trying to revive peace negotiations with Saudi help. But continuing America’s historic refusal to recognize Israel’s rights in Jerusalem would have meant continuing to allow U.S. policy to be held hostage by extremists who have no interest in peace on any terms.

Advertisement

While any mention of a shift on Jerusalem is being treated as demonstrating pro-Israel bias and a virtual Trump declaration of war on Middle East peace, the likely details of the statement contradict those assumptions. If Trump fails to refer to Jerusalem as a “united” city, he will actually be preserving the ambiguity in the U.S. position that peace-process advocates claim is necessary to keep the flagging hopes for a two-state solution alive.

The 1947 United Nations partition resolution, which called for the creation of Jewish and Arab states in what was then British Mandate for Palestine, set aside Jerusalem as an international zone. This impractical plan was a dead letter from the outset, since neither the Palestinian Arabs nor the rest of the Arab and Muslim world were prepared to accept the creation of a Jewish state even if it did not include even part of the holy city and was matched by a new Arab nation. But the lack of international sanction for Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem that has served as the pretext for non-recognition of the city’s status as the capital is no bar to a two-state solution. In what must now be conceded as the unlikely prospect that the Palestinian Authority will ever agree to peace with Arab neighborhoods in the city serving as a capital for a second state, what possible reason could anyone have for opposing American recognition that western Jerusalem is Israeli?

The answer is painfully obvious.

The ceasefire that ended the first Arab–Israeli war in 1949 left Jerusalem split, with the western portion controlled by Israel and the rest, including the Old City and the most sacred Jewish shrines, occupied (illegally, as far as every nation in the world other than Britain and Pakistan were concerned) by Jordan. In 1967, the Six-Day War ended with the barriers dividing the city torn down as Israeli forces unified Jerusalem. The Jewish state soon annexed the portions that Jordan had occupied, but the international community still did not recognize Israel’s hold on the city and the continued presence of its government.

The conceit of a two-state solution is that both Israel and the putative Palestine would have their capital in Jerusalem. How the city would be repartitioned without reverting to its pre-1967 status, in which two armed enemies were separated only by ugly walls and a no man’s land, has never been made clear. Moreover, despite the constant criticism of Israel’s desire to keep the capital united — the only time in history that the holy places of the three monotheistic religions have been open to all has been during the last 50 years of Israeli sovereignty — or its building of new Jewish neighborhoods there or settlements elsewhere in the West Bank, the main reason why a Palestinian state has not been created is the Palestinians’ refusal to accept such a solution. Israel offered the Palestinians independence in a state that included a share of Jerusalem in 2000, 2001, and 2008 but was turned down each time (first by Yasir Arafat and then by his successor Mahmoud Abbas).

That’s why Trump giving U.S. recognition to western Jerusalem as Israel’s capital is not even a theoretical bar to a two-state solution. Yet Palestinians consider even that minimal step, without moving the U.S. embassy to the place where Israel’s government actually sits, a flagrant insult to their national pride — and many of their supporters feel the same way. If their anger is expressed in riots, which might bring to mind the reaction to 2005 publication of satirical cartoons in a Danish newspaper, then Trump will be accused of fomenting violence.

But while all of Trump’s predecessors considered this threat reason enough to avoid recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital — which entailed signing repeated waivers to a 1995 law that mandated moving the U.S. embassy there — what this does is essentially allow terrorists to dictate U.S. policy on a matter that wouldn’t preclude peace.

What the foreign-policy establishment — including many State Department veterans responsible for decades of failure in the Middle East — also fails to see is that allowing that current situation to continue is itself a barrier to peace. As long as the Palestinians and their foreign enablers are allowed to hold on to the illusion that their century-old war on Zionism will eventually succeed, the sea change in their political culture that might enable peace will never happen. While there is little chance that Trump’s attempt to jolt them into reality will succeed, such a change is a prerequisite for successful negotiations, not a barrier to them.

It is wrong to blame Trump for any violence or subsequent lack of progress toward peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

That said, it should also be conceded that Trump’s entirely defensible stand on Jerusalem is at odds with the strategy his son-in-law is pursuing toward Middle East peace. Kushner’s “outside-in” approach, which rests on the assumption that the Saudis can bribe or bully an unwilling Palestinian Authority and its Hamas rivals into peace, is just as unlikely to succeed as any other plan. It’s hard to imagine the Saudis’ willingly allowing themselves to be construed as backing Israeli sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem even if Riyadh views the Jewish state as an ally against Iran and has little real sympathy for the addition of another unstable Arab nation to the region. That illustrates the uncoordinated and often confused attitude of a Trump administration that similarly can’t decide between its justified hostility toward Iran and its desire for détente with Russia.

But no matter what happens after Trump’s Jerusalem statement, it is wrong to blame him for any violence or subsequent lack of progress toward peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The continued Palestinian refusal to accept the legitimacy of a Jewish state or Jewish ties to Jerusalem that is made manifest by their threats of a new intifada over a largely meaningless gesture by Trump remains the real problem. Trump may not be advancing a peace process that is already doomed, but he may give those willing to look clearly at the situation another demonstration of Palestinian intransigence.

Donald Trump Strikes a Blow Against Anti-Semitism Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"
2167.0,"It’s similarly unclear what would happen to the bodegas, grocery stores, and big-box retailers that benefit from customers spending their SNAP money, generating roughly $1.80 in economic activity for every $1 in benefits. “Fierce competition in the food-retail industry drives consumer prices down, therefore benefiting those on a limited food budget more than anyone,” said Greg Ferrara of the National Grocers Association, the lobbying group for supermarkets. The association is “extremely concerned with the president’s budget proposal, as it abandons the proven free-market model on the ill-advised assumption that the government can purchase and provide food more efficiently than its current private-sector partners.”

Other questions left unaddressed: what would happen if boxes went missing, what would happen during hurricanes and snowstorms, how the USDA would accommodate homeless SNAP recipients, whether it had done studies of the nutrition and health impact of the boxes, what kind of calorie and macronutrient counts they would contain, how it would decide what went in the boxes, whether companies could lobby on the contents of the boxes, whether states could opt out, whether the boxes would create social stigma, whether food producers were on board with the proposal, and whether projected rates of food insecurity would fall.

“We don’t know why this was developed, nor how it would work, nor why it would be a benefit to anybody,” said Ellen Vollinger of the Food Research & Action Center, a leading anti-hunger nonprofit. “I haven’t found anybody who was consulted, nor anybody who understands it. The retailers aren’t clamoring for a proposal like this, nor were we, nor were the food bankers, nor were recipients. It’s hard for me to even understand why USDA would want to impose that kind of work on themselves.”

I asked the USDA whether it had held meetings with stakeholders in developing the plan, and who had advised them on it. “Since he was sworn into office, Secretary Perdue has traveled thousands of miles all across the country, visiting over 30 states to meet with people whose lives are impacted by the work we are doing at USDA and to hear their concerns,” a spokesman responded.

Perhaps, as with so many things Trump, the proposal was never meant to be taken literally. Republicans on the Hill have indicated that they have no intention of adopting it, and the administration doesn’t appear to be doing any legwork to get them behind it, either. Trump officials described it to The New York Times as something of a policy troll, a “gambit by fiscal hawks in the administration aimed at outraging liberals and stirring up members of the president’s own party.”

But that does not mean it was not meant seriously. The harvest-box proposal is one of many made by the Trump administration that would increase the restrictiveness and paternalism of the country’s major safety-net programs—by having the government pick out people’s food for them, imposing work requirements on Medicaid recipients and expanding their use in SNAP, drug testing recipients of unemployment benefits, and slashing rental assistance for able-bodied individuals. Those reforms have come hand-in-hand with requests for deep, deep budget cuts, including $200 billion to SNAP, made through the implementation of the harvest-box proposal as well as changes to eligibility and benefit levels in the current voucher program. Nutrition experts fear that the policy impact of those cuts would be straightforward: deeper poverty and more hunger.

The association is “extremely concerned with the president’s budget proposal, as it abandons the proven free-market model on the ill-advised assumption that the government can purchase and provide food more efficiently than its current private-sector partners.”

Other questions left unaddressed: what would happen if boxes went missing, what would happen during hurricanes and snowstorms, how the USDA would accommodate homeless SNAP recipients, whether it had done studies of the nutrition and health impact of the boxes, what kind of calorie and macronutrient counts they would contain, how it would decide what went in the boxes, whether companies could lobby on the contents of the boxes, whether states could opt out, whether the boxes would create social stigma, whether food producers were on board with the proposal, and whether projected rates of food insecurity would fall.

“We don’t know why this was developed, nor how it would work, nor why it would be a benefit to anybody,” said Ellen Vollinger of the Food Research & Action Center, a leading anti-hunger nonprofit. “I haven’t found anybody who was consulted, nor anybody who understands it. The retailers aren’t clamoring for a proposal like this, nor were we, nor were the food bankers, nor were recipients. It’s hard for me to even understand why USDA would want to impose that kind of work on themselves.”

I asked the USDA whether it had held meetings with stakeholders in developing the plan, and who had advised them on it. “Since he was sworn into office, Secretary Perdue has traveled thousands of miles all across the country, visiting over 30 states to meet with people whose lives are impacted by the work we are doing at USDA and to hear their concerns,” a spokesman responded.

Perhaps, as with so many things Trump, the proposal was never meant to be taken literally. Republicans on the Hill have indicated that they have no intention of adopting it, and the administration doesn’t appear to be doing any legwork to get them behind it, either. Trump officials described it to The New York Times as something of a policy troll, a “gambit by fiscal hawks in the administration aimed at outraging liberals and stirring up members of the president’s own party.”

But that does not mean it was not meant seriously. The harvest-box proposal is one of many made by the Trump administration that would increase the restrictiveness and paternalism of the country’s major safety-net programs—by having the government pick out people’s food for them, imposing work requirements on Medicaid recipients and expanding their use in SNAP, drug testing recipients of unemployment benefits, and slashing rental assistance for able-bodied individuals. Those reforms have come hand-in-hand with requests for deep, deep budget cuts, including $200 billion to SNAP, made through the implementation of the harvest-box proposal as well as changes to eligibility and benefit levels in the current voucher program. Nutrition experts fear that the policy impact of those cuts would be straightforward: deeper poverty and more hunger.

2206.0,"There are a lot of insults you can throw at someone. But the one many women would probably agree burns the most is ""fat.""

It's also incredibly common. Roughly 40 percent of overweight people experience judgment, criticism, or humiliation at least once a week, according to a 2015 survey of over 2,500 people by Slimming World, a science-based weight-loss program based in the U.K. (akin to our Weight Watchers). That includes everything from having strangers hurl insults at them to not being able to get served at a bar. What's more, formerly overweight folks reported that with their slimmer figure, strangers were more likely to make eye contact, smile, and say hello.

Sadly, we didn't really need a survey to tell us this. Anyone who has set foot on a playground or who has been on the Internet knows the word ""fat"" is the go-to insult-regardless of how much someone actually weighs. Twitter trolls throw the term around like P. Diddy threw parties in the '90s. And even if you're a non-bully and good social media citizen, have you ever gotten a slight sense of satisfaction when your ex or high school nemesis put on a few pounds?

We may tell ourselves that fat stigma is concern over people's health, but let's not kid ourselves. Do bullies really care about health when they're insulting people because of their weight? (Bullying has harmful effects on health, so definitely not.) And if that were the case, wouldn't smokers be shunned the same way? Smoking is bad for your health, right?

Some might argue that it all comes down to our standard of beauty. But America's problem with those who are overweight goes much, much deeper than that. After all, if it were all just about what society deems beautiful, why not hate on people for breakouts or wrinkles just as much? Of course, we shouldn't insult people at all, but the point is, this is more than just pounds.

""Fat is the ultimate insult because of the assumptions it carries,"" says Samantha Kwan, Ph.D., associate professor of sociology at the University of Houston and co-author of Framing Fat: Competing Constructions in Contemporary Culture. With just a glance at someone's silhouette, we make assumptions about her status, motivation level, emotional balance, and general worth as a human. And it goes wayyy deeper than simply the cultural norms of beauty. Here are four common assumptions-plus why they're just that. Because understanding the problem is the first step in fixing it.

Myth #1: Being thin = status and wealth.

For a long period in history, plumpness was a sign of being wealthy and well-fed. But in the mid 19th century, that started to change. Work became more mechanized and more sedentary, and railroads were built, making food more accessible for everyone, explains Amy Farrell, Ph.D., professor of women's, gender, and sexuality studies at Dickinson College and author of Fat Shame: Stigma and the Fat Body in American Culture. ""As waistlines increased across the country, a thinner body became a sign of being civilized, and those ideas have stayed with us,"" she says.

Reality: Weight is so much more than money.

""There's a deeply rooted idea that in order to be respectable or civilized, you can't have fat,"" says Farrell. We equate the ability to afford healthy food as a luxury for the wealthy, and thinness has become even more of a status symbol because you need time and money to go to the gym and cook from scratch. We know weight is so much more than money-there's genetics, hormones, biology, psychology. But praising thinness because someone has overcome all these things is really praising someone for having spare time to devote to body management, Farrell says.

A lot of this logic goes back to what we learned from bullies in childhood. ""Making judgments works really well for consolidating power. When you're in grade school, if you're the elite kid in class, people pay attention to you while you mock kids with less social power. You point and say, 'Those are inferior people,' and other kids listen,"" Farrell adds.

Myth #2: Fat = lack of ambition or motivation.

We've all heard the idea that everyone could lose weight if they just tried harder-ate less, exercised more. ""People assume that those who are fat don't have the strength of character to change their bodies,"" Kwan says. ""Our cultural discourses reinforce stereotypes that fat individuals are lazy, don't exercise, and are preoccupied with food consumption. They are stereotyped as lacking in self-discipline, as greedy, selfish, and careless."" Fat folks indulge in base desires-greed, envy, gluttony, and sloth-so says society.

The bigger storyline, though, is that being fat is a slight on everything Americans pride themselves on-striving and working for a better life. So even though being overweight is certainly American, carrying ""extra"" weight threatens the two most American ideals of all: that with enough hard work, anyone can improve their standing in life, and that all Americans have this unified American dream.

Reality: Goals are greater than the scale.

For starters, there's the assumption that everyone has the same goal-to be thin-when the smarter goal is really to be healthy. Obesity is the second leading cause of death in this country largely because it increases one's risk for other deadly diseases like heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. But some research suggests it's not necessarily weight that increases this risk as much as inactivity, and there are certainly overweight people who are more physically fit than thin people. (See more: What's a Healthy Weight Anyway?)

Then there's the implication that your weight is entirely within your control, even though research shows that physiologically our bodies would rather hold onto fat than let go of it, Farrell points out. And this idea of fat folks lacking motivation also assumes overweight people have plenty of free time that they are choosing to spend on the couch. In reality, there are plenty of other reasons the weight just won't budge.

Myth #3: Fat women don't value themselves, so we shouldn't value them either.

""We live in a makeover society where individuals, but especially women, are expected to spend the time, money, and physical and emotional energy to make themselves 'beautiful,'"" Kwan says. ""This is our cultural script."" Since the media has bombarded us for the past half-century with the idea that all it takes is eating less and exercising more, this must mean larger ladies just don't care enough to expend the energy and resources to lose weight, right?

Reality: Self-worth isn't measured in pounds.

While diet and exercise are certainly two factors that influence weight gain, so are a whole slew of things that are out of our immediate control: genetics, birth weight, childhood weight, ethnicity, age, medications, stress levels, and socioeconomic status, according to the Institute of Medicine. Researchers put the influence of genetics on weight anywhere from 20 to 70 percent, and a landmark study in the '80s found adopted children raised separately from their biological parents still ended up with a similar weight to them in adulthood, rather than having a weight similar to the adoptive parents who raised them and shaped their eating and exercise habits.

Most importantly, though, is that self-worth isn't tied to weight, and weight also doesn't automatically denote a high self-worth. Both Kwan and Farrell point out that thinness can sometimes be the result of unhealthy behaviors, like crash dieting and taking pharmaceuticals. Someone who is nourishing her body and mind with food is probably more in tune with her own happiness and satisfaction than someone who is starving herself for weight loss.

Myth #4: Fat people are unhappy.

""We look at someone who's fat and see someone who doesn't take care of herself, and is therefore emotionally unbalanced and unwell,"" Farrell says.

Classic research shows we associate positive characteristics with those who meet our culture's beauty standards. ""We tend to think of someone who is thin and beautiful as having a more successful and happier life (regardless of whether this is true) than someone who is less traditionally attractive,"" Kwan explains. It's called the halo and horns effect-the idea that you can assume intangible characteristics based solely on someone's appearance. In fact, a landmark study in the journal Sex Roles found that thinner white women were perceived as not only having more successful lives, but also better personalities than heavier white women.

Reality: Weight says nothing about well-being.

First off, there are plenty of women who are totally happy with how they look, but less than pleased with how they're treated because of how they look-which is why speaking out against fat-shaming is so important to set the record straight. And while some people do gain weight as a result of stress or depression, people also lose weight because they're unhappy and gain weight when they're most satisfied. For example, a study in Health Psychology found happily married couples gained more weight than spouses who weren't as satisfied with their relationships.

And again, activity might go further than weight. People who exercise on the reg are less stressed and anxious, more confident, more creative, and generally happier than people who don't move much. As far as physical health goes, a study in Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases found that fit people had comparable rates of death regardless of whether they were a ""healthy"" weight or overweight. A study in the American Journal of Cardiology looked at muscle mass, body fat, and people's risk of heart disease and death. They found that while high muscle/low fat group was the healthiest, the ""fit and fat"" group (high fat but also high muscle) came in second, ahead of the group with low body fat but no muscle (aka those who were thinner but inactive).

Here's how we can change.

It's painful and embarrassing to realize these deeply embedded assumptions we have as a culture. But it's really important to acknowledge them: ""These ideas are dangerous because they legitimize discrimination,"" Farrell says.

And the exposure is working: A new study from Florida State University found that women are more likely to pay attention to and remember average and plus-size models compared to thin models. And when larger ladies were on screen, women in the study made fewer comparisons and had higher levels of body satisfaction within themselves. Magazines, including Shape, are putting forth more effort than ever before to consider the message we're projecting about what ""healthy"" really means. And good thing, considering a study in the International Journal of Obesity found people's belief that weight is controllable, ideas around the real health risks of being fat, and their tendency to weight discriminate was directly related to whether they read and watched media that was either fat positive or fat negative.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, many of us live in quiet desperation. Farmers are committing suicide, and so are taxi drivers in New York City. That's why in the battle for the soul of our country, we must win.

Most of us are sinking, and there's no bottom. This is the ugly face of capitalism. That's why so many people have joined the Democratic Socialists of America.

Why do so many of us live in pain because of bad teeth or bad backs, unable to afford medical care because an insurance or drug company rations it to make a buck? It doesn't have to be this way, but a small elite benefits from the status quo. They keep all the rest of us fighting and killing over scraps with talk of racial superiority or bathroom scares, or fear of poor and working people in other countries.

We deserve better. We have a right to the wealth our labor creates. We demand democracy. And we demand freedom from struggling and toiling to barely survive, while a small group of the super wealthy live like modern-day kings.

We should hold politicians accountable to us

We joined the DSA to fight back, because these oligarchs depend on us, and therein lies our power.

We are the ones who through our labor make this country go. What would happen if we all stood together across our differences to demand better wages and working conditions, our own unions? Or better yet, cooperative ownership of our own workplaces?

We must make politicians serve our interests, instead of those of their wealthy owners. Republicans give massive tax breaks to the very rich. Republicans cut health care and attack Social Security. Even the Wall Street wing of the Democrats supports luxury development instead of affordable housing. That's because we're not holding them accountable.

1. Why has President Trump recertified the deal, not once but twice?

Advertisement

This is shameful. Remember, Trump insisted throughout the 2016 campaign that the deal — formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — was the worst and most dangerous in the history of deals. Just two weeks ago, addressing the U.N. General Assembly, he described it as an “embarrassment” and “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.” Yet, under the statute that calls for presidential findings every 90 days, the president, in recertifying, represented to Congress and the American people (a) that Iran is “transparently, verifiably, and fully implementing the agreement” and (b) that continuing the JCPOA is “vital to the national security interests of the United States.”

These assertions insult the intelligence.

The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is charged with what laughably passes for the “monitoring” of the JCPOA and related “side agreements,” which the Obama administration shielded from congressional inspection. Last week, the IAEA fessed up: The agency has been unable to verify that Tehran is implementing the deal. The regime has barred inspectors from inspecting military sites. Consequently, as the invaluable analyst Omri Ceren points out, the IAEA has no way of verifying that Iran has refrained from “activities which could contribute to the design and development of a nuclear explosive device” (as required by the JCPOA’s Annex 1, Section T — see here, at p. 27).

This admission is not news. It just makes the obvious — the inevitable — explicit. It has been widely known from the first that the JCPOA is not verifiable, despite the Obama administration’s guarantees that it would be. It has long been known, moreover, that Iran is not in compliance with many of the JCPOA’s terms. That, too, illustrates the duplicity by which Obama sought his foreign-policy legacy monument: To get the deal approved by Congress — or, at least, to get it not disapproved under the cockamamie Corker-Cardin legislation — the prior administration solemnly pledged to hold the mullahs to the letter (and, of course, that this could be done verifiably). Obama officials further vowed that sanctions would “snap back” if Iran failed to comply. Once the deal got its congressional stamp of non-disapproval, though, we learned that Obama was quietly waiving violations left and right, and had even agreed to limits on what the IAEA could report — the better to conceal Iran’s breaches.

Bottom line: Iran has never, not for a moment, been “transparently, verifiably, and fully implementing” the JCPOA. The Obama administration knew this all along — and knew it would go this way. The Trump State Department, which is chockablock with Obama holdovers and has heavily lobbied the new president to stand by the deal, has known it from Day One.

And what about that second representation: vital to the national-security interests of the United States?

Seriously? With a straight face?

Quite apart from violating the terms of the JCPOA and refusing to permit verifiable inspections from the start, Iran continues to be the world’s No. 1 sponsor of anti-American terrorism, backing Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Taliban, a network of Iraqi cells, and the Houthis in Yemen, to cite just the best-known examples. That’s not just me talking; the regime continues to be one of just three countries on the U.S. government’s official terrorist list (the others are Syria, which is Iran’s cat’s-paw, and Sudan, which has longstanding ties to the regime in Tehran).

Iran continues to be the world’s No. 1 sponsor of anti-American terrorism.

Moreover, Iran maintains its aggressive program of ballistic-missile development in defiance of Security Council resolutions. In fact, less than three months ago, Trump imposed new sanctions on regime officials and abettors. Iran is exporting arms and personnel to fortify Assad’s barbarism in Syria. It continues to threaten Israel’s destruction — in fact, two of the ballistic missiles it has test-fired were inscribed in Hebrew “Israel must be wiped out.” The mullahs are substantially responsible for the massive Hezbollah build-up (including an arsenal estimated at well over 100,000 missiles) that raises the distinct possibility of a catastrophic war. And, still proud to be the “Death to America” regime, Iran continues to abduct American hostages and menace American naval vessels.

Now, as you take all that in, understand: The tens of billions of dollars’ worth of sanctions relief Tehran has gotten under the JCPOA, including pallets stacked with billions in ransom cash that Obama threw in for good measure, are helping to pay for all of this anti-American malignity. Yet, we are told — multiple times — that maintaining this arrangement is somehow in the vital national-security interests of the United States.

On what planet?

2. What should Trump do after (finally) decertifying?

It is time to walk away.

As our former colleague Eliana Johnson reports at Politico, a scheme is afoot in the Trump administration to decertify the Iran deal without killing it. The idea is that the administration would keep the deal alive rather than push Congress to reinstate the sanctions, while endeavoring to persuade Iran and the other parties to the deal to renegotiate it.

This is a terrible plan.

To begin with, how much more betrayal are we supposed to endure? The Obama administration started down this path assuring the nation that Iran would be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. Obama then struck a deal that, by its own terms (i.e., even if there were no cheating), merely delayed Iran while paving its way to the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Obama officials promised exacting verification protocols and then made an agreement in which Iran’s performance of its obligations could not be verified. Obama officials promised full disclosure but withheld key portions of the deal, then conspired with Iran to conceal its lack of compliance — even as Iran continued its anti-American provocations.

Advertisement

We were encouraged to swallow hard and accept all of this on the assurance that the sanctions could and would be “snapped back” into place if the deal failed to change Iran’s behavior. Now, with Iran’s behavior as appalling as ever, Trump — the guy who campaigned on what a lousy deal it is — reportedly has cold feet about snapping back the sanctions.

The rationalization for keeping the JCPOA is that Iran has already gotten most of the deal’s goodies. Abandoning the deal now would hurt us more than the mullahs, the thinking goes, because it would relieve them of the deal’s burdens.

That’s preposterous. Under the terms of the JCPOA and its undisclosed side deals, we do not and cannot know whether Iran is performing its obligations. More significantly, even if we could verify and even if Iran were in compliance, the deal does not prevent Iran from acquiring nukes; it just slows the mullahs down for a few more years.

Plainly, then, the deal is not in American interests. “But wait,” the decertify-but-don’t-kill-it crowd argues, “we will make it in our interests by improving it.”

Nonsense. If you keep the JCPOA, you have to try to fix it within the framework of the JCPOA . . . under circumstances in which Iran insists it will not renegotiate and our “partner” nations — who now have lucrative financial intercourse with Tehran — will balk. In other words, you would already be negotiating in order to try to preserve something that should never have been agreed to in the first place — and from there, you’d have to plead for accommodations.

It is better to walk away.

If you keep the JCPOA, you have to try to fix it within the framework of the JCPOA.

What the Iran-deal apologists never mention is that the United States still has enormous leverage in the form of the American economy. Even with the relief Iran has gotten, it is still feeling the pain of being walled off from commerce in U.S. dollars. An aggressive sanctions regimen would punish not only Iran but governments and corporations that do business with Iran. As former Senate staffer Richard Goldberg recounts, this kind of pressure works.

Would there be caterwauling by countries, their heavy-hitter businesses, and even such American companies as Boeing that chase profits in Iran? Yes, of course. If the Trump administration were serious, though, these calculating players would understand in short order that, if they want access to the $19 trillion U.S. economy, they must shun Iran.

They would shun Iran. And while Iran might not change its behavior, what I am proposing presents the only realistic chance of convincing Iran to change its behavior, especially if we unapologetically pursue other ways to squeeze the regime — as opposed to preserving the JCPOA, which obliges us to be supportive of the regime.

Trump the Businessman has long maintained that the art of the deal is knowing when to walk away from the table — when to take a tack antithetical to Obama’s no-concession-is-too-big approach. It is time to walk away from the table. The JCPOA is an atrocious deal that deserves to die. If the president wants to negotiate, let it be on a new deal and on America’s terms — which, you may remember, are that Iran does not get nuclear weapons, must honor its obligations on weapons development and proliferation, and must cease promoting terrorism.

No other deal is worth having.

2383.0,"President Donald Trump has challenged his Secretary of State to a battle of the wits – but intelligence experts don’t think that’s such a good idea.

The President lashed out at Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a recent interview with Forbes, responding to reports that Mr Tillerson had called him a “moron” during a Pentagon meeting. (The State Department denies this occurred.) Tensions between the two men have simmered in recent weeks, and some say the Secretary of State is planning his departure.

“I think it’s fake news, but if he did that, I guess we’ll have to compare IQ tests,” Mr Trump said of the ""moron"" comments. “And I can tell you who is going to win.”

Joel Schneider, a Temple University professor who studies the assessment of intelligence, says he can tell, too.

“My money's on Tillerson,” he told The Independent, pointing to the Secretary's previous experience as CEO of Exxon Mobil.

“Large companies like that generally aren't run by unintelligent people,"" he said.

The Justice Department later clarified: Obama had not, in fact, done so Reuters 28/30 Claiming there had been 3 million 'illegal votes' Trump was never very happy about losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 2.8 million ballots. So, he and White House voter-fraud commissioner Kris Kobach have claimed that anywhere between three and five million people voted illegally during the 2016 election. Conveniently, he says that all of those illegal votes went to Clinton.

While his response to the disaster in Houston was generally applauded, the president picked up some flack when he gave a speech outside Houston (he reportedly did not visit disaster zones), and praised the size of the crowds there AP 19/30 'Little Rocket Man' During his first-ever speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Trump tried out a new nickname for North Korea leader Kim Jong-un: Rocket Man. He later tweaked it to be “little Rocket Man” as the two feuded, and threatened each other with nuclear war. During that speech, he also threatened to totally annihilate North Korea 20/30 Attacking Sadiq Khan following London Bridge terror attack After the attack on the London Bridge, Trump lashed out at London Mayor Sadiq Khan, criticising Khan for saying there was “no reason to be alarmed” after the attack.

So, he and White House voter-fraud commissioner Kris Kobach have claimed that anywhere between three and five million people voted illegally during the 2016 election. Conveniently, he says that all of those illegal votes went to Clinton. (There is no evidence to support that level of widespread voter fraud.) 29/30 Leaving Jews out of the Holocaust memorial statement Just days after taking office, Trump’s White House issued a statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, but didn’t mention “jews” or even the word “jewish” in the written statement Getty 30/30 Anger over Inauguration crowd size Trump’s inauguration crowd was visibly, and noticeably, smaller than that of his predecessor, Barack Obama. But, he really wanted to have had the largest crowd on record. So, he praised it as the biggest crowd ever. Relatedly, Trump also claimed that it stopped raining in Washington at the moment he was inaugurated. It didn’t, the day was very dreary Reuters

Stephen Ceci, a Professor of Developmental Psychology at Cornell University, declined to comment on the match-up, but said Mr Trump would likely come in somewhere in the “mid-range” of IQ scores, based on his word usage and lack of inhibition.

Mr Schneider, however, thinks the former businessman would actually be considered ""bright"" compared to the general population (though not, he stimulated, compared to past presidents).

“People criticise his vocabulary, which is extremely narrow, but every once in awhile he'll let a $20 word out, [so] you can tell that he actually does know these words,” Mr Schneider said.

He added that the President’s winding, wordy sentence structure actually indicates a good short-term memory.

“His mind wanders as he talks a lot, but what's striking to me is that he usually finishes his sentences, no matter how long they are,” Mr Schneider said. “He doesn't lose track.”

Mr Trump’s more obvious public gaffes – mispronouncing the Turkish President's name, or telling an audience in Israel he ""just got back from the Middle East"" – don’t stem from a low intelligence, Mr Schneider said. Instead, they come his “lack of intellectual curiosity”.

“His bad moves generally come from his narcissism, and his arrogance, and his extreme centeredness,” he said. “He doesn't seem to know very much, because all he cares about is himself. And he knows a great deal about himself.”

Jack Naglieri, a psychological research professor who also develops intelligence tests, has a different theory. He believes Mr Trump is lacking in “executive function” – the process of strategising, evaluating, decision making, and impulse control.

According to Mr Naglieri, strong executive function is a “hallmark of intelligence,"" and makes for a more modern, reliable indicator than notoriously imprecise IQ tests.

“It's very, very clear that Trump lacks this critical executive function,” Mr Naglieri said, pointing to the President’s outbursts, impulsivity, and apparent lack of empathy and insight.

“The tweeting is an obvious impulse control problem,” Mr Naglieri said.

As for who would win in a battle of the wits, the researcher is “absolutely” on team Tillerson.

“Tillerson is clearly a person who has impulse control, who thinks things through,” he said. “...He's not blurting out, he's not impulsive, he's not flying off the handle. He's not telegraphing his anger like Trump does.”

“I'd put my money on Tillerson any day,” he added.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

The President lashed out at Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a recent interview with Forbes, responding to reports that Mr Tillerson had called him a “moron” during a Pentagon meeting. (The State Department denies this occurred.) Tensions between the two men have simmered in recent weeks, and some say the Secretary of State is planning his departure.

“I think it’s fake news, but if he did that, I guess we’ll have to compare IQ tests,” Mr Trump said of the ""moron"" comments. “And I can tell you who is going to win.”

Joel Schneider, a Temple University professor who studies the assessment of intelligence, says he can tell, too.

“My money's on Tillerson,” he told The Independent, pointing to the Secretary's previous experience as CEO of Exxon Mobil.

“Large companies like that generally aren't run by unintelligent people,"" he said.

2398.0,"Politically, Biden’s position made sense. Most white voters in Delaware opposed busing. And just three years earlier, in 1972, the Democratic presidential nominee, George McGovern, had prompted a revolt among working- and middle-class whites with his defense of the policy. McGovern tried to reframe the issue, asking white voters if “stopping the buses is really going to give them all the other things they want: jobs, homes, healthy families, better schools, safe communities — futures to look forward to with pride.” It didn’t work.

“Support for it was a difficult case to make to white working people who felt that integration was taking place on their backs,” the historian Jefferson Cowie explains in “Stayin’ Alive: The 1970s and the Last Days of the Working Class.” “Immediate defense of white identity, home, and school readily trumped the abstract hope of a better world someday.”

Biden’s sensitivity to the fears and anxieties of his white constituents helps explain his positions on drugs and crime in the 1980s and 1990s. He was an ardent drug warrior and “tough on crime” Democrat who hoped to outflank the Republican Party on those issues, winning ground from worried white voters. “One of my objectives, quite frankly, is to lock Willie Horton up in jail,” he said in 1990 when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

That line, which refers to a notorious political ad from the 1988 presidential election, gets to the heart of Biden’s appeal in that era. He was working for voters who viewed cities and their denizens as carriers of crime and disorder who should be controlled if they couldn’t be isolated. His central work on the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, like President Bill Clinton’s later support for welfare reform, was part of a larger effort to position the Democratic Party as both a defender of white middle-class interests and as a disciplinarian — in clamping down on assumed black pathologies of criminality, promiscuity and dependency. Biden himself was trying to take this path in the 1988 election, before he derailed his campaign by plagiarizing a British Labor Party leader.

No one is their past, however, and it’s possible Biden has morally and politically redeemed himself through his association with Barack Obama’s historic presidency. And Biden has been supportive of civil rights laws as well as a strong ally to groups like the N.A.A.C.P. At the same time, however, the former vice president has only tentatively addressed his intimate role in building the modern incarceration state, and he still defends his position on busing.

The questions, then, are simple: Are Biden’s politics still racialized? Is his blue-collar and Middle American appeal still an implicit affirmation of white racial privilege?

If it is, then a Biden candidacy may be one where he tries to capture the supposed center of American politics by presenting himself as the real embodiment of working-class white identity against Trump’s inauthentic embrace of the blue-collar worldview.

Consider the message this would send. For decades Biden gave liberal cover to white backlash. He wasn’t an incidental opponent of busing; he was a leader who helped derail integration. He didn’t just vote for punitive legislation on crime and drugs; he wrote it. His political persona is still informed by that past, even if he were to repudiate those positions now. Biden could lead Democrats to victory over Trump, but his political style might affirm the assumptions behind Trumpism. The outward signs of our political dysfunction would be gone, but the disease would still remain.

2458.0,"A LEADING expert on Korea has slammed the idea that Donald Trump is responsible for bringing Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table.

Supporters say Mr Trump was the X-factor that brought the two Korean leaders together on Friday for a historic meeting on the border between the two nations.

But Professor Robert E Kelly said the US President could not claim credit for the breakthrough and argued instead that Mr Trump had agreed to a summit with the North Korean leader in exchange for nothing.

In a Twitter thread, Prof Kelly ridiculed Vice President Mike Pence’s argument that Mr Trump brought Kim to the table without making concessions.

Mr Pence on Friday praised the US President, saying North Korea’s promise to denuclearise showed the strength of Mr Trump’s leadership.

In a statement, Mr Pence said it was also a clear sign the intense pressure of sanctions was working.

However Prof Kelly said there was no evidence that Mr Trump’s “belligerence” had led to the peace agreement.

Prof Kelly also highlighted how the US made concessions, not Kim.

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is among those praising Mr Trump, telling Fairfax that the President’s unpredictable approach had led to the meeting between Mr Kim and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in.

‘NOBEL, NOBEL’

Mr Kelly’s comments come as Mr Trump’s supporters called for him to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

During a campaign-style rally in Michigan on Saturday, Mr Trump told supporters his critics used to say he would drag the world into nuclear war.

“Months ago, do you remember what they were saying? ‘He’s going to get us into nuclear war,’ they said,” Mr Trump told supporters in Washington Township, north of Detroit.

“No, strength is going to keep us out of nuclear war, not going to get us in.”

The US leader has been eager to play up his role in achieving a breakthrough with Pyongyang through his “maximum pressure” campaign involving tough rhetoric, stronger sanctions and diplomatic efforts to further isolate the regime.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un reportedly said he would give up his nuclear weapons if the US promised not to invade during the high-level talks with Mr Moon on Friday.

Supporters at the Michigan rally called out “Nobel, Nobel” for Mr Trump’s help in bringing North Korea to the negotiating table.

“That’s very nice, thank you. That’s very nice,” he said.

“I just want to get the job done.”

However Mr Trump said he was prepared to walk away if US demands for North Korea to relinquish its atomic arsenal were not met.

Ms Bishop called on Mr Trump to be given the highest praise if he can broker permanent peace on the Korean peninsula.

However when asked if the US President should be awarded the Noble Peace Prize on ABC Radio this morning, she said there was a long way to go.

“If we were to witness a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula and a denuclearised Korean Peninsula, that would be an extraordinary outcome and would be deserving of the highest praise,” she said.

FLATTERING TRUMP

Australian National University Southeast Asia Institute director John Blaxland said there was a good reason for flattering Mr Trump.

“There is a strong imperative for foreign leaders to flatter Trump by crediting him with being the catalyst for bringing Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table,” Professor Blaxland said.

“Governments want to avoid Trump’s wrath, his economic sanctions and related threats.”

He also said it was Kim, not the US President, who could claim credit for the talks taking place.

“It is Kim who has repeatedly taken the initiative, testing nukes, firing missiles, calling for a summit, offering to close facilities and cease testing,” Prof Blaxland said.

“These were all calls by Kim Jong-un, not Donald Trump.”

However Prof Blaxland said added that no one side could claim the credit.

“Trump’s apparent credibility as the ‘madman’ leader, prepared to cross the threshold of war to get his way over North Korea, is reinforced by the appointment of the new national security adviser, the unreconstructed and unrepentant advocate of the Iraq invasion of 2003, John Bolton,” he said.

“Moon Jae-in came to office in South Korea on a platform of reconciliation with North Korea and has been working hard to facilitate rapprochement.

“And besides, we have been here before, on the cusp of a breakthrough, on a frequency of about once a decade since the end of the Cold War. Now, of course, North Korea has a stronger bargaining position, being effectively a de facto member of the nuclear weapons club.”

Leonid Petrov, a visiting fellow at the Australian National University College of Asia and the Pacific, said there was one party that hadn’t been acknowledged in all of this.

“The Australian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister praise Trump and acknowledge (Chinese president) Xi’s contribution but forget to thank Moon and Putin for the inter-Korean summit,” he said.

“Without Russia joining the sanctions and South Korea effectively undermining them there would not be any progress in trust-building and peacemaking in Korea.”

TRUMP’S TRAP?

Malcolm Davis, senior analyst in defence strategy and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said while Mr Trump had claimed the credit for bringing the North to the table, he believed he was falling into a potential trap.

“The North Koreans have developed their nuclear and missile capabilities to the point whereby they have a credible nuclear deterrent against the United States,” Dr Davis said.

“They can play Moon’s desire for North-South reconciliation for all they can get in terms of concessions. They’ll promise the world, but give nothing back in return.”

Dr Davis said the Panmunjom Declaration was big on flowery rhetoric but short on substance and specifics, and he believed the North Koreans would string out the process.

“I’d actually say that Kim Jong-un made all this possible because he has an exploitative strategy, and Moon bought into that strategy because it is music to his ears, and Trump, being Trump rushed to claim the credit when in fact he’s potentially walking into a trap in June,” he said.

However Dr Davis did give the US President credit for taking a more robust stance through military pressure and sanctions compared to previous administrations.

Danny Katch explains why the spread of the “Abolish ICE” demand not only makes sense in Trumpian times, but offers a welcome way forward for immigrant justice.

THE EXPLOSION of protests against the horrors of separating refugee families has put a spotlight on the almost equally sudden emergence of calls to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

The adoption of the “Abolish ICE!” demand among numerous immigrant justice organizations represents a dramatic left turn for a movement that for the past decade has often seemed powerless to resist compromised proposals from supposed allies in the Democratic Party to accept more deportations and border security in exchange for the ever-more-distant prospect of “comprehensive immigration reform.”

In an influential Nation article titled “It’s Time to Abolish ICE,” Sean McElwee described in March the disastrous impact of these years of Beltway negotiations.

“White supremacy can no longer be the center of the immigration debate,” McElwee wrote. “Democrats have voted to fully fund ICE with limited fanfare, because in the American immigration discussion, the right-wing position is the center, and the left has no voice.”

Protesting the ICE reign of terror against immigrants

As the idea of a bipartisan immigration solution with Trumpists has become increasingly ludicrous, the call to dismantle ICE as well as Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is becoming a litmus test for left candidates running in Democratic primaries. As NBC News recently put it, the abolition demand:

was confined to the fringes just months ago in a party that has historically balanced calls for better treatment of migrants with support for stronger border security and enforcement. But as an emboldened left challenges old assumptions about everything from health care to jobs, doing away with ICE has become the latest issue left-wing insurgents can use to differentiate themselves from more established rivals in Democratic primaries, especially as mainstream party candidates increasingly co-opt other contrast issues, like Medicare for All and a $15 minimum wage.

Fifteen Democrats in congressional primaries have called for abolishing ICE, and last week, they were joined by New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon, who told the hosts of The View: “Children just aren’t being separated at the border, they’re being separated throughout this country by ICE. I think we need to abolish ICE. That seems really clear.”

The terrain has shifted so quickly that even Bernie Sanders, the person who inspired most of these progressives, is in danger of being left behind.

On Sunday, Sanders refused to join the abolition call and instead meekly called for Congress to pass more “rational” immigration policies — by sitting down with Trump! He sounded all too much like the vapid centrist Democrats he’s inspired so many people to revile.

WHAT EXACTLY would it mean to abolish ICE?

Nixon, like most candidates who have taken up the call, emphasizes the practical dimensions of the demand. “ICE is relatively new,” she said on The View. “They came in after September 11 — we’d been handling immigration and customs for a long time here. We don’t need ICE.”

Her point is that the U.S. should return to the days when the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) oversaw legal immigration and border enforcement, before anti-terror policies created the Department of Homeland Security and two agencies within it — ICE and CBP — solely tasked with detaining and deporting immigrants.

Of course, this country has a history of mass deportations and anti-immigrant repression dating back long before 2001, and abolishing ICE alone won’t reverse decades of laws criminalizing people for crossing the border.

But even the limited call to return to 20th-century policy is an important break with the post-9/11 bipartisan consensus around militarized borders and seeing immigration through the inherently racist lens of “anti-terrorism.”

Beyond these considerations, however, “Abolish ICE” isn’t just a policy proposal. It is an assertion of the principle that no human being is illegal, and that our side won’t ratify the criminalization of immigrants in exchange for some of them gaining a chance at a reprieve.

It’s also a framework for any number of stand-alone demands — no longer shackled to the rotten compromise of “comprehensive reform” — that include cutting funding for ICE and CBP, ending the notorious “bed quota” that fills privately run detention centers, a moratorium on deportations, and recognizing the right of all refugees to apply for asylum without facing imprisonment.

Just as importantly, an abolitionist movement can reinforce the rapidly growing sense that ICE is an immoral agency with which one simply cannot collaborate.

From the blockade of ICE offices in Portland, Oregon, to the refusal of airline workers to work on flights transporting separated children, to the efforts of workers at Microsoft and Amazon to end their companies’ technologies being used to aid immigration authorities, our side is rapidly radicalizing in actions as well as words.

WHILE RADICAL immigrant justice groups have long called for abolition, the idea started gaining steam last year with campaigns to #DefundHate from groups like Detention Watch Network and United We Dream.

Soon, the call for abolition was being taken up by liberal groups like the Center for Popular Democracy and the political action committee Brand New Congress.

The most obvious reason for the proliferation of abolition calls is, of course, Trump — whose openly racist support for mass deportations exposed ICE and CBP as the sick and inhumane agencies they always have been.

Under Trump, the media has paid more attention to ICE outrages, like abducting parents as they drive their children to school, stalking courthouses to seize women looking for protection from domestic violence and snatching a brain-tumor patient right from her hospital bed.

But beyond that, deportations and detentions today are more obviously aligned with a far-right agenda than many progressives were willing to admit when Barack Obama was president.

As McElwee wrote, “The central assumption of ICE in 2018 is that any undocumented immigrant is inherently a threat. In that way, ICE’s tactics are philosophically aligned with racist thinkers like Richard Spencer and the writers at the white-supremacist journal VDare.”

But it would be wrong to see “Abolish ICE” only as a response to Trump administration atrocities that were tolerated under Democrats like Obama and Bill Clinton — especially since that’s exactly how Trump and the whining conservative media are trying to frame the widespread outrage over family separation.

On the contrary, the demand is a clear rejection of the “comprehensive reform” framework that would trade an eventual “path to citizenship” for some in exchange for increased persecution of other current and all future undocumented immigrants.

This rotten compromise imposed on immigrants by Democrats has put our movement in a downward spiral of ever-rightward shifting negotiations for the past 10 years.

The crisis of Trump’s border concentration camps has revealed what might the biggest flaw of the Democrats’ reform proposals. Far from being “comprehensive,” conceding increased border militarization in exchange for a path to citizenship does absolutely nothing for the millions of migrants and refugees who are not here yet, but are arriving today and in the coming years.

By asserting that migration is not a crime, the call to abolish ICE and CBP can allow activists who have long been hamstrung by comprehensive immigration reform to come out full stop for the rights of our sisters and brothers to enter this country.

“THE CALL to abolish ICE is, above all, a demand for the Democratic Party to begin seriously resisting an unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state that it had a hand in creating,” wrote McElwee in the Nation.

Don’t expect party leaders to take this challenge lying down. “I understand the community’s hatred of this law enforcement organization,” Obama policy advisor Cecilia Muñoz said on a Slate podcast. “But at the end of the day, as a policy goal, I don’t think abolishing ICE is realistic.”

“I also think the argument...has the potential to push away folks who ultimately we need on our side in order to make the kinds of reforms in the way ICE behaves and in the immigration laws themselves,” she added.

We can expect this second point — that calls to abolish ICE will scare away moderate voters in the midterm elections and keep Trump’s Republicans in power — to intensify greatly as November approaches.

As is so often the case, what Democrats claim to be merely a disagreement over electoral strategy is, in reality, a fundamental debate — not only about immigration but the meaning of genuine resistance to Trump’s far-right agenda.

The original abolitionist movement against slavery grew rapidly in the 1850s by mobilizing direct resistance to the hated Fugitive Slave Law on the basis that people of conscience had a higher authority to obey than the immoral laws written by slave owners in Congress.

That’s the spirit emerging from people’s horror at Trump’s border policies, and it’s not one that leaders of either party — or their corporate funders — wish to encourage.

For all the rightful talk of Trump’s unique nastiness, nothing does more to “normalize” him than the idea that the trauma and pain he’s inflicting every day can be neatly undone on a couple of election days in 2018 and 2020, just as the system intended.

The call to abolish ICE as an irredeemably racist and harmful institution points in a different direction for a growing left that needs to gain the confidence and vision to be at least as radical as the right we’re fighting.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.
