Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Yeah , just only {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : Okay , fine . So I I think it's very fancy . Project Manager : So {disfmarker} Yeah , that's how I think . User Interface : Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so {disfmarker} Marketing : So I'll give it a {disfmarker} Project Manager : Ye Marketing : Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah , this {disfmarker} It is a one . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : It's okay . It's cool . Marketing : I think it's one . Okay , next . Project Manager : This is a difficult one , because we we don't {disfmarker} Yeah , we don't know it about the {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} Learnable ? Easy to use ? Yeah , we shall test it {vocalsound} But uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : Uh {vocalsound} it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : It's {disfmarker} That's {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : No , but you don't have to use that . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . Project Manager : No . Industrial Designer : That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it . User Interface : So I think it's easy to use , but {disfmarker} And learnable is a bit {disfmarker} Marketing : Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . Industrial Designer : Well , I think it is . Marketing : Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . User Interface : Well y just uh f Marketing : I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or Project Manager : But the rest of it is very easy , Marketing : {disfmarker} Uh then the re Project Manager : because there are so so n User Interface : Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does . Industrial Designer : So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function . User Interface : Yes . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} Marketing : But {disfmarker} Project Manager : And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device . Marketing : Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? User Interface : Device . Marketing : And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it . And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls . Project Manager : But {disfmarker} yeah . Marketing : 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um {vocalsound} easy to use . User Interface : Okay . Marketing : Because easy to use comes after learnable . Project Manager : Okay , just {disfmarker} Easy to use is very cool , Marketing : I I think it a three or something . Project Manager : so just give it a two . User Interface : Maybe three then . Learnable's {disfmarker} Project Manager : No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm uh . The normal . User Interface : Yeah okay . Yeah . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know {disfmarker} User Interface : Yep , true . Then a two . Marketing : Oh . Okay .

Project Manager : Slide is not n is is not new . No . I already have a {disfmarker} Marketing : Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control . Project Manager : Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : So that's not new . User Interface : But also slide that buttons come out , as well ? Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Okay . Marketing : Okay , and the the the lightning ? Project Manager : That's cool . Marketing : Is that new ? Project Manager : Yeah for a {disfmarker} Uh for a f Marketing : The lighting's new . User Interface : Yes . Industrial Designer : Mm it's pretty new , I think . Marketing : Scrollwheel . Speech ? Industrial Designer : Speech is new . User Interface : Different colours , so {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : So we have a pretty new uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : There are no games on it , that's that's {disfmarker} It's not a one , it's a two again . User Interface : That would {disfmarker} And we didn't uh {disfmarker} Marketing : It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something . User Interface : But then we also have the the home station . Project Manager : If you have {disfmarker} User Interface : We are forgetting about that now , but {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable . Marketing : Uh-oh . User Interface : We don't Marketing : Home-station . User Interface : recharge . Industrial Designer : Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but {disfmarker} User Interface : But that's more like uh now . Project Manager : Yeah , just draw it afterwards . {gap} Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing . User Interface : I don't know . Project Manager : If you {disfmarker} Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ? User Interface : Uh {disfmarker} Just save , save as ? Project Manager : Yeah . Mm-hmm . Uh save as ? No , that's not in the project . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven . Project Manager : Oh yeah , okay . Smart board . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , but this one . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : This one is not yet in the {disfmarker} Oh oh . Industrial Designer : I think it is . Project Manager : {gap} Marketing : {gap} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah , it is . Industrial Designer : No , I think it is . User Interface : Uh untitled ? Project Manager : {gap} User Interface : Yeah , it doesn't matter . Save . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : But you still have to draw the resi the recharger . Marketing : Uh all {vocalsound} the the seven , uh all the seven . Project Manager : Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . But not {disfmarker} Marketing : No , we are not extraordinary new or something . Project Manager : No , just so it's still a two . User Interface : N Industrial Designer : Mm two , I think . Marketing : Tha tha that {disfmarker} Project Manager : Targeted audience . Uh we are the targeted audience ? Do we like it ? Marketing : {vocalsound} No , we we we searched for uh um {vocalsound} a young group , audience , beneath f forty . Project Manager : Yeah , but l younger than forty . So we we are exactly the targeted group . Marketing : Yes . Yeah , but did we reach , um {vocalsound} with our uh style , the targeted audience ? Project Manager : I think so , yeah . Marketing : Th that's my question . Project Manager : You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : So you want {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So Marketing : Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : think that's a two or a one . Marketing : Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh {disfmarker} {gap} That's {gap} that's {gap} {vocalsound} That's this question . Industrial Designer : Yeah , but s it {disfmarker} That's basically not not handy . And {vocalsound} I don't thi I don't see {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah , this . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . Marketing : So we targeted it ? But we didn't follow the latest trends . Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} No . Yeah , you could make a a front User Interface : Mm . I think we followed the latest trends . Industrial Designer : a front that's that's like uh like a banana , {vocalsound} or something . Marketing : Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh {vocalsound} get on my computer . User Interface : Oh right . Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , you get different colours . User Interface : You can different front uh {disfmarker} Marketing : Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : So {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Like a a f banana kind of front . Marketing : Oh yeah . But spongy will never be . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : No . Marketing : So we give ourself a three or something . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : {gap} Project Manager : Oh . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : So that's eleven . Marketing : That's uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} Marketing : What's the average ? Industrial Designer : Eleven divided by six . Project Manager : Yeah , it is one point eight three . Marketing : A perfect score . {vocalsound} No , I don't know . Industrial Designer : We're not too hard on ourselves . {vocalsound} User Interface : This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up . Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay . Marketing : And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep . User Interface : To call . Project Manager : Oh yeah , that's still {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : Um {disfmarker} Marketing : Call {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep . Project Manager : Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one . User Interface : Okay . No no , I want that in . Marketing : That's {disfmarker} Yeah , but it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo . Marketing : {vocalsound} No , we need that . That's usable . That's really usable . Industrial Designer : If you do uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay . Marketing : It's {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : So I just got a financial um {disfmarker} User Interface : Yes uh . Project Manager : {gap} You s {vocalsound} saved it or {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . I did save it . Project Manager : No . Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me . It just is a battery . Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . But okay . So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Mm {vocalsound} okay . Marketing : {vocalsound} That's fine . Industrial Designer : But uh is uh uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : So that's both . Marketing : Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three . Project Manager : Yeah , and single curved curved . Industrial Designer : But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or {disfmarker} Project Manager : No , that's not on the list . But that shouldn't be {gap} . Industrial Designer : Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah , we can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Probably . I just {disfmarker} The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was {disfmarker} I'm not sure . User Interface : Um {vocalsound} different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah . Project Manager : See it's {disfmarker} I think it's okay like this . Marketing : Special form , yeah . {vocalsound} Project Manager : It's hard to say . But maybe we have to um {disfmarker} Yeah , {gap} okay . Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : We get different ones , that's all . So you can put a recharger in it as well . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} But this is expensive , the sample speaker . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : This ? Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , it's four . Marketing : Four . It's four Euros . User Interface : Oh , them . Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , that's included . Marketing : {vocalsound} So we are {disfmarker} User Interface : Okay , then we then we need to use it . Industrial Designer : It's kind of weird that we {vocalsound} we get this information now , afterwards . Because {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah , no . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this {gap} . User Interface : Damn , solar cells are uh expensive . Project Manager : So {gap} I just want you {disfmarker} Yeah , we just made it . So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together . Marketing : Okay .

Marketing : Or a different style . Industrial Designer : then there {vocalsound} we probably have been creative . User Interface : I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} Marketing : So it's creativity . Industrial Designer : Huh . Project Manager : Okay , so the leadership {disfmarker} Was there a leadership and {disfmarker} User Interface : Of course there was . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : What do you have to say about that ? Industrial Designer : No , I think {disfmarker} Marketing : Who was the leader ? {vocalsound} Project Manager : I dunno . Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} Just normal discussion , I think .

User Interface : So I think it's easy to use, but {disfmarker} And learnable is a bit {disfmarker} Marketing : Learnable? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control. Industrial Designer : Well, I think it is. Marketing : Because because I think I think the scroll wheel, uh it's very handy, but the first time you get this thing in your hands, it's not to use the scroll wheel. User Interface : Well y just uh f Marketing : I think uh you must uh seek for it, and up or down or Project Manager : But the rest of it is very easy, Marketing : {disfmarker} Uh then the re Project Manager : because there are so so n User Interface : Yeah, I think it's very clear what it all does. Industrial Designer : So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function. User Interface : Yes. Marketing : Yeah. User Interface : But the second parts, uh like speech, etcetera, that will be harder to learn. Marketing : Okay. Project Manager : So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use. Marketing : Okay. User Interface : {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} Marketing : But {disfmarker} Project Manager : And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well, if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device. Marketing : Yeah. But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things, huh? User Interface : Device. Marketing : And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls. So we h we have speech, uh the scroll wheel, and um the the the slide. You must slide it. And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls. Project Manager : But {disfmarker} yeah. Marketing : 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um {vocalsound} easy to use. User Interface : Okay. Marketing : Because easy to use comes after learnable. Project Manager : Okay, just {disfmarker} Easy to use is very cool, Marketing : I I think it a three or something. Project Manager : so just give it a two. User Interface : Maybe three then. Learnable's {disfmarker} Project Manager : No, but definitely better, much better than uh than uh than avera average, yeah. Industrial Designer : Mm uh. The normal. User Interface : Yeah okay. Yeah. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know {disfmarker} User Interface : Yep, true. Then a two. Marketing : Oh. Okay. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Project Manager : Okay. {vocalsound} Marketing : New features. Techno technological innovative? Industrial Designer : The speech function and the colour. Colour. Marketing : {vocalsound} The speech function is new. User Interface : And the scrollwheel, backlights, slide. Marketing : The scrollwheel and the slide. Uh I think the slide is pretty new. Project Manager : Slide is not n is is not new. No. I already have a {disfmarker} Marketing : Uh I only saw it in a telephone, not in an remote control. Project Manager : Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight. And they all have a slide in it. Marketing : Okay. Project Manager : So that's not new. User Interface : But also slide that buttons come out, as well? Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah. User Interface : Okay. Marketing : Okay, and the the the lightning? Project Manager : That's cool. Marketing : Is that new? Project Manager : Yeah for a {disfmarker} Uh for a f Marketing : The lighting's new. User Interface : Yes. Industrial Designer : Mm it's pretty new, I think. Marketing : Scrollwheel. Speech? Industrial Designer : Speech is new. User Interface : Different colours, so {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah, different fronts for a remote control, I think that's new too. User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : So we have a pretty new uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : There are no games on it, that's that's {disfmarker} It's not a one, it's a two again. User Interface : That would {disfmarker} And we didn't uh {disfmarker} Marketing : It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something. User Interface : But then we also have the the home station. Project Manager : If you have {disfmarker} User Interface : We are forgetting about that now, but {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah. Oh yeah, that's right. Rechargeable. Marketing : Uh-oh. User Interface : We don't Marketing : Home-station. User Interface : recharge. Industrial Designer : Yeah, we didn't draw that too, but {disfmarker} User Interface : But that's more like uh now. Project Manager : Yeah, just draw it afterwards. {gap} Industrial Designer : Yeah, that's just a normal th s simple thing. User Interface : I don't know. Project Manager : If you {disfmarker} Can you save it on the same, in the same map as the other ones? In the the project uh map? User Interface : Uh {disfmarker} Just save, save as? Project Manager : Yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh save as? No, that's not in the project. User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Well it's a already in the folder. L like number seven. Project Manager : Oh yeah, okay. Smart board. Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : Yeah, but this one. User Interface : Okay. Project Manager : This one is not yet in the {disfmarker} Oh oh. Industrial Designer : I think it is. Project Manager : {gap} Marketing : {gap} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah, it is. Industrial Designer : No, I think it is. User Interface : Uh untitled? Project Manager : {gap} User Interface : Yeah, it doesn't matter. Save. Industrial Designer : Okay. Project Manager : But you still have to draw the resi the recharger. Marketing : Uh all {vocalsound} the the seven, uh all the seven. Project Manager : Okay. And new features, so we give it a two or also again a one? No, I think i if you have games on it, then then you give you have a one. But not {disfmarker} Marketing : No, we are not extraordinary new or something. Project Manager : No, just so it's still a two. User Interface : N Industrial Designer : Mm two, I think. Marketing : Tha tha that {disfmarker} Project Manager : Targeted audience. Uh we are the targeted audience? Do we like it? Marketing : {vocalsound} No, we we we searched for uh um {vocalsound} a young group, audience, beneath f forty. Project Manager : Yeah, but l younger than forty. So we we are exactly the targeted group. Marketing : Yes. Yeah, but did we reach, um {vocalsound} with our uh style, the targeted audience? Project Manager : I think so, yeah. Marketing : Th that's my question. Project Manager : You get the fancy things for younger people. And you get the the aesthetic things for older people. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Project Manager : So you want {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel, and that's what attracts the young audience. So Marketing : Yeah. Yeah. Industrial Designer : think that's a two or a one. Marketing : Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh {disfmarker} {gap} That's {gap} that's {gap} {vocalsound} That's this question. Industrial Designer : Yeah, but s it {disfmarker} That's basically not not handy. And {vocalsound} I don't thi I don't see {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah, this. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah. Marketing : So we targeted it? But we didn't follow the latest trends. Industrial Designer : Yeah. {vocalsound} No. Yeah, you could make a a front User Interface : Mm. I think we followed the latest trends. Industrial Designer : a front that's that's like uh like a banana, {vocalsound} or something. Marketing : Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh {vocalsound} get on my computer.

15,"Grad H : Yeah , I 've been playing with , um uh , using the close - talking mike to do {disfmarker} to try to figure out who 's speaking . So my first attempt was just using thresholding and filtering , that we talked about {disfmarker} about two weeks ago , and so I played with that a little bit , and {vocalsound} it works O K , {pause} except that {pause} it 's very sensitive to your choice of {vocalsound} your filter width and your {vocalsound} threshold . So if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone 's talking and when they 're not . But if you try to use the same paramenters on another speaker , it doesn't work anymore , even if you normalize it based on the absolute loudness . PhD B : But does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole meeting ? Grad H : It does work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting . Um Pretty well . PhD A : How did you do it Adam ? Grad H : Pretty well . How did I do it ? PhD A : Yeah . Grad H : What do you mean ? PhD A : I mean , wh what was the {disfmarker} Grad H : The algorithm was , uh take o every frame that 's over the threshold , and then median - filter it , {vocalsound} and then look for runs . PhD A : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Grad H : So there was a minimum run length , PhD A : Every frame that 's over what threshold ? Grad H : so that {disfmarker} A threshold that you pick . PhD A : In terms of energy ? Ah ! Grad H : Yeah . PhD A : OK . Postdoc F : Say that again ? Frame over fres threshold . Grad H : So you take a {disfmarker} each frame , and you compute the energy and if it 's over the threshold you set it to one , and if it 's under the threshold you set it to zero , {vocalsound} so now you have a bit stream {pause} of zeros and ones . Postdoc F : Hmm . OK . Grad H : And then I median - filtered that {vocalsound} using , um {pause} a fairly long {pause} filter length . Uh {pause} well , actually I guess depends on what you mean by long , you know , tenth of a second sorts of numbers . Um and that 's to average out you know , pitch , you know , the pitch contours , and things like that . And then , uh looked for long runs . Postdoc F : OK Grad H : And that works O K , if you fil if you tune the filter parameters , if you tune {vocalsound} how long your median filter is and how high you 're looking for your thresholds . PhD A : Did you ever try running the filter before you pick a threshold ? Grad H : No . I certainly could though . But this was just I had the program mostly written already so it was easy to do . OK and then the other thing I did , was I took {vocalsound} Javier 's speaker - change detector {disfmarker} acoustic - change detector , and I implemented that with the close - talking mikes , and {pause} unfortunately that 's not working real well , and it looks like it 's {disfmarker} the problem is {disfmarker} he does it in two passes , the first pass {vocalsound} is to find candidate places to do a break . And he does that using a neural net doing broad phone classification and he has the {vocalsound} the , uh {pause} one of the phone classes is silence . And so the possible breaks are where silence starts and ends . And then he has a second pass which is a modeling {disfmarker} a Gaussian mixture model . Um looking for {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} whether it improves or {disfmarker} or degrades to split at one of those particular places . And what looks like it 's happening is that the {disfmarker} even on the close - talking mike the broad phone class classifier 's doing a really bad job . PhD A : Who was it trained on ? Grad H : Uh , I have no idea . PhD A : Hmm . Grad H : I don't remember . Does an do you remember , Morgan , was it Broadcast News ? Professor D : I think so , yeah . Grad H : Um {pause} So , at any rate , my next attempt , {pause} which I 'm in the midst of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the {vocalsound} uh , thresholding as the way of generating the candidates . Because one of the things that definitely happens is if you put the threshold low {vocalsound} you get lots of breaks . All of which are definitely acoustic events . They 're definitely {vocalsound} someone talking . But , like , it could be someone who isn't the person here , but the person over there or it can be the person breathing . And then feeding that into the acoustic change detector . And so I think that might work . But , I haven't gotten very far on that . But all of this is close - talking mike , so it 's , uh {pause} just {disfmarker} just trying to get some ground truth . PhD E : Only with eh uh , but eh I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think , eh when {disfmarker} when , y I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I saw the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the speech from PDA and , eh {pause} close {pause} {vocalsound} talker . I {disfmarker} I think the there is a {disfmarker} a great difference in the {disfmarker} in the signal . Grad H : Oh , absolutely . PhD E : Um but eh I {disfmarker} but eh I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean that eh eh {pause} in the {disfmarker} in the mixed file {vocalsound} you can find , uh {pause} zone with , eh {pause} great different , eh {pause} level of energy . Grad H : So {pause} s my intention for this is {disfmarker} is as an aide for ground truth . not {disfmarker} PhD E : Um {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I think for , eh {pause} algorithm based on energy , {pause} eh , that um h mmm , {disfmarker} more or less , eh , like eh {pause} eh , mmm , first sound energy detector . Grad H : Say it again ? PhD E : eh nnn . When y you the detect the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the first at {disfmarker} at the end of {disfmarker} of the {vocalsound} detector of , ehm princ um . What is the {disfmarker} the name in English ? the {disfmarker} the , mmm , {pause} {vocalsound} the de detector of , ehm of a word in the {disfmarker} in the s in {disfmarker} an isolated word in {disfmarker} in the background That , uh Grad H : I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not sure what you 're saying , can you try {disfmarker} PhD E : I mean that when {disfmarker} when you use , eh {pause} eh {pause} any PhD A : I think he 's saying the onset detector . PhD E : Yeah . Grad H : Onset detector , OK . PhD E : I {disfmarker} I think it 's probably to work well eh , because , eh {pause} you have eh , in the mixed files a great level of energy . eh {pause} and great difference between the sp speaker . And probably is not so easy when you use the {disfmarker} the PDA , eh that {disfmarker} Because the signal is , eh {pause} the {disfmarker} in the e energy level . Grad H : Right . PhD E : in {disfmarker} in that , eh {pause} eh {pause} speech file {vocalsound} is , eh {pause} more similar . between the different eh , speaker , {vocalsound} um {pause} I {disfmarker} I think is {disfmarker} eh , it will {pause} i is my opinion . Grad H : Right . But different speakers . PhD E : It will be , eh {pause} more difficult to {disfmarker} to detect bass - tone energy . the {disfmarker} the change . I think that , um Grad H : Ah , in the clo in the P D A , you mean ? PhD E : In the PDA . Grad H : Absolutely . PhD E : Yeah . Yeah . Grad H : Yeah , no question . It 'll be much harder . Professor D : Yeah . Grad H : Much harder . PhD E : And the {disfmarker} the another question , that when I review the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the work of Javier . I think the , nnn , the , nnn , {pause} that the idea of using a {pause} neural network {vocalsound} to {disfmarker} to get a broad class of phonetic , eh {pause} from , eh uh a candidate from the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the speech signal . If you have , eh {vocalsound} uh , I 'm considering , only because Javier , eh {pause} only consider , eh {pause} like candidate , the , nnn , eh {pause} the silence , because it is the {disfmarker} the only model , eh {disfmarker} eh , he used that , eh {pause} {vocalsound} eh {pause} nnn , to detect the {disfmarker} the possibility of a {disfmarker} a change between the {disfmarker} between the speaker , Grad H : Right . PhD E : Um {pause} another {disfmarker} another research thing , different groups , eh {pause} working , eh {pause} on Broadcast News {vocalsound} prefer to , eh {pause} to consider hypothesis eh {pause} between each phoneme . Grad H : Mm - hmm . Yeah , when a {pause} phone changes . PhD E : Because , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think it 's more realistic that , uh {pause} only consider the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the silence between the speaker . Eh {pause} there {disfmarker} there exists eh {pause} silence between {disfmarker} between , eh {pause} a speaker . is {disfmarker} is , eh {pause} eh {pause} acoustic , eh {pause} event , important to {disfmarker} to consider . Professor D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD E : I {disfmarker} I found that the , eh {pause} silence in {disfmarker} in many occasions in the {disfmarker} in the speech file , but , eh {pause} when you have , eh {pause} eh , two speakers together without enough silence between {disfmarker} between them , eh {pause} {vocalsound} I think eh {pause} is better to use the acoustic change detector basically and I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I IX or , mmm , BIC criterion for consider all the frames in my opinion . Professor D : Mm - hmm . Yeah , the {disfmarker} you know , the reason that he , uh {pause} just used silence {vocalsound} was not because he thought it was better , it was {disfmarker} it was {disfmarker} it was the place he was starting . PhD E : Yeah . Grad H : Yep . Professor D : So , he was trying to get something going , PhD E : Yeah . Professor D : and , uh e e you know , as {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as is in your case , if you 're here for only a modest number of months you try to pick a realistic goal , PhD E : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Grad H : Do something . Professor D : But his {disfmarker} his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also . PhD E : Uh - huh . But , eh {pause} do {disfmarker} do you think that if you consider all the frames to apply {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the , eh {pause} the BIC criterion to detect the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the different acoustic change , {vocalsound} eh {pause} between speaker , without , uh {pause} with , uh {pause} silence or {vocalsound} with overlapping , uh , I think like {disfmarker} like , eh {pause} eh a general , eh {pause} eh {pause} way of process the {disfmarker} the acoustic change . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD E : In a first step , I mean . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD E : An - and then , eh {pause} {vocalsound} eh {pause} without considering the you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you , um {pause} you can consider the energy {vocalsound} like a another parameter in the {disfmarker} in the feature vector , eh . Grad H : Right . Absolutely . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD E : This {disfmarker} this is the idea . And if , if you do that , eh {pause} eh , with a BIC uh criterion for example , or with another kind of , eh {pause} of distance in a first step , {vocalsound} and then you , eh {pause} you get the , eh {pause} the hypothesis to the {disfmarker} this change acoustic , {vocalsound} eh {pause} {vocalsound} to po process Grad H : Right . PhD E : Because , eh {pause} eh , probably you {disfmarker} you can find the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} eh {pause} a small gap of silence between speaker {vocalsound} with eh {pause} eh {pause} a ga mmm , {pause} {vocalsound} small duration Less than , {vocalsound} eh {pause} two hundred milliseconds for example Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD E : and apply another {disfmarker} another algorithm , another approach like , eh {pause} eh {pause} detector of ene , eh detector of bass - tone energy to {disfmarker} to consider that , eh {vocalsound} that , eh {pause} zone . of s a small silence between speaker , or {vocalsound} another algorithm to {disfmarker} to process , {vocalsound} eh {pause} the {disfmarker} the segment between marks eh {pause} founded by the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} the BIC criterion and applied for {disfmarker} for each frame . Professor D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD E : I think is , eh {pause} nnn , it will be a an {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} a more general approach {vocalsound} the {pause} if we compare {disfmarker} with use , eh {pause} a neural net or another , eh {pause} speech recognizer with a broad class or {disfmarker} or narrow class , because , in my opinion eh {pause} it 's in my opinion , {vocalsound} eh if you {disfmarker} if you change the condition of the speech , I mean , if you adjust to your algorithm with a mixed speech file and to , eh {vocalsound} to , eh {pause} {vocalsound} adapt the neural net , eh {pause} used by Javier with a mixed file . Professor D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD E : uh With a m mixed file , Grad H : With the what file ? PhD A : "" Mixed "" . PhD E : with a {disfmarker} the mix , mix . Postdoc F : "" Mixed . "" Grad H : "" Mixed ? "" Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD E : Sorry . And {pause} and then you {disfmarker} you , eh you try to {disfmarker} to apply that , eh , eh , eh , speech recognizer to that signal , to the PDA , eh {pause} speech file , {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I think you will have problems , because the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {pause} condition {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you will need t t I {disfmarker} I suppose that you will need to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to retrain it . Professor D : Well , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Grad H : Oh , absolutely . This is {disfmarker} this is not what I was suggesting to do . Professor D : u {vocalsound} Look , I {disfmarker} I think this is a {disfmarker} One {disfmarker} once {disfmarker} It 's a {disfmarker} I used to work , like , on voiced {disfmarker} on voice silence detection , you know , and this is this {pause} kind of thing . PhD E : Really ? Yeah . Professor D : Um {pause} If you {vocalsound} have somebody who has some experience with this sort of thing , and they work on it for a couple months , {vocalsound} they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily . Then you say , "" OK , I don't just wanna get most of the cases I want it to be really accurate . "" Then it gets really hard no matter what you do . So , the p the problem is is that if you say , "" Well I {disfmarker} I have these other data over here , {vocalsound} that I learn things from , either explicit training of neural nets or of Gaussian mixture models or whatever . "" PhD E : Yeah . Professor D : Uh {pause} Suppose you don't use any of those things . You say you have looked for acoustic change . Well , what does that mean ? That {disfmarker} that means you set some thresholds somewhere or something , PhD E : Yeah . Professor D : right ? and {disfmarker} and so {vocalsound} where do you get your thresholds from ? PhD E : Yeah . Professor D : From something that you looked at . So {vocalsound} you always have this problem , you 're going to new data um {pause} H how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data ? {vocalsound} Uh , if it 's gonna be different from old data that you have ? And I think that 's a problem {pause} with this . Grad H : Well , also what I 'm doing right now is not intended to be an acoustic change detector for far - field mikes . What I 'm doing {vocalsound} is trying to use the close - talking mike {vocalsound} and just use {disfmarker} {pause} Can - and just generate candidate and just {pause} try to get a first pass at something that sort of works . PhD E : Yeah ! PhD A : You have candidates . PhD G : Actually {disfmarker} actually {disfmarker} actually {disfmarker} PhD E : the candidate . PhD G : I {disfmarker} PhD A : to make marking easier . Yeah . PhD G : Or {disfmarker} Grad H : and I haven't spent a lot of time on it and I 'm not intending to spend a lot of time on it . PhD G : OK . I {disfmarker} um , I , unfortunately , have to run , Grad H : So . PhD G : but , um {pause} I can imagine {pause} uh building {pause} a {pause} um {pause} model of speaker change {pause} detection {pause} that {vocalsound} takes into account {pause} both the far - field and the {vocalsound} uh {pause} actually , not just the close - talking mike for that speaker , but actually for all of th {pause} for all of the speakers . Grad H : Yep . Everyone else . Professor D : Yeah . PhD G : um {pause} If you model the {disfmarker} {pause} the {pause} effect that {pause} me speaking has on {pause} your {pause} microphone and everybody else 's microphone , as well as on that , {vocalsound} and you build , um {disfmarker} basically I think you 'd {disfmarker} you would {pause} build a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an HMM that has as a state space all of the possible speaker combinations Grad H : All the {disfmarker} Yep . PhD E : Yeah . PhD G : and , um {vocalsound} you can control {disfmarker} Grad H : It 's a little big . PhD G : It 's not that big actually , um Grad H : Two to the N . Two to the number of people in the meeting . Professor D : But {disfmarker} Actually , Andreas may maybe {disfmarker} maybe just something simpler but {disfmarker} but along the lines of what you 're saying , Grad H : Anyway . PhD E : Yeah . Professor D : I was just realizing , I used to know this guy who used to build , uh {vocalsound} um , mike mixers {disfmarker} automatic mike mixers where , you know , t in order to able to turn up the gain , you know , uh {vocalsound} as much as you can , you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you lower the gain on {disfmarker} on the mikes of people who aren't talking , PhD G : Mmm . PhD E : Yeah {comment} Yeah . PhD G : Mmm . Mm - hmm . Professor D : right ? And then he had some sort of {vocalsound} reasonable way of doing that , PhD G : Mm - hmm . Professor D : but {vocalsound} uh , what if you were just looking at very simple measures like energy measures but you don't just compare it to some threshold {pause} overall but you compare it to the {vocalsound} energy in the other microphones . Grad H : I was thinking about doing that originally to find out {pause} who 's the loudest , and that person is certainly talking . Professor D : Yeah . Grad H : But I also wanted to find threshold {disfmarker} uh , excuse me , mol overlap . Professor D : Yeah . Grad H : So , not just {disfmarker} just the loudest . PhD E : But , eh Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . PhD E : I {disfmarker} I Sorry . I {disfmarker} I have found that when {disfmarker} when I I analyzed the {disfmarker} the speech files from the , {pause} eh {pause} mike , eh {pause} from the eh close eh {pause} microphone , eh {pause} I found zones with a {disfmarker} a different level of energy . PhD G : Sorry , I have to go . Grad H : OK . Could you fill that out anyway ? Just , {pause} put your name in . Are y you want me to do it ? I 'll do it . PhD A : But he 's not gonna even read that . Oh . Grad H : I know . PhD E : including overlap zone . including . because , eh {pause} eh {pause} depend on the position of the {disfmarker} of the microph of the each speaker {vocalsound} to , eh , to get more o or less energy {vocalsound} i in the mixed sign in the signal . and then , {vocalsound} if you consider energy to {disfmarker} to detect overlapping in {disfmarker} in , uh , and you process the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the speech file from the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the mixed signals . The mixed signals , eh . I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's difficult , um {vocalsound} {pause} only to en with energy to {disfmarker} to consider that in that zone We have eh , eh , overlapping zone Eh , if you process only the the energy of the , of each frame . Professor D : Well , it 's probably harder , but I {disfmarker} I think what I was s nnn noting just when he {disfmarker} when Andreas raised that , was that there 's other information to be gained from looking at all {vocalsound} of the microphones and you may not need to look at very sophisticated things , PhD E : Yeah . Professor D : because if there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if most of the overlaps {disfmarker} you know , this doesn't cover , say , three , but if most of the overlaps , say , are two , {vocalsound} if the distribution looks like there 's a couple high ones and {disfmarker} and {pause} the rest of them are low , PhD E : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Grad H : And everyone else is low , yeah . Professor D : you know , what I mean , PhD E : Yeah . Professor D : there 's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures . PhD E : Yeah . Yeah . Professor D : Uh , by the way , I had an idea with {disfmarker} while I was watching Chuck nodding at a lot of these things , is that we can all wear little bells on our heads , {vocalsound} so that {vocalsound} then you 'd know that {disfmarker} PhD E : Yeah . Grad H : Ding , ding , ding , ding . PhD E : Yeah . Postdoc F : "" Ding "" . That 's cute ! PhD B : I think that 'd be really interesting too , with blindfolds . Then {disfmarker} Grad H : Nodding with blindfolds , PhD B : Yeah . The question is , {pause} like {pause} whether {disfmarker} Grad H : "" what are you nodding about ? "" PhD B : Well , trying with and {disfmarker} {pause} with and without , yeah . Grad H : "" Sorry , I 'm just {disfmarker} I 'm just going to sleep . "" PhD B : But then there 's just one @ @ , like . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : Actually , I saw a uh {disfmarker} a woman at the bus stop the other day who , um , was talking on her cell phone {vocalsound} speaking Japanese , and was bowing . you know , profusely . PhD B : Oh , yeah , that 's really common . PhD C : Yeah . PhD E : Yeah {comment} Yeah . PhD A : Just , kept {disfmarker} PhD E : Yeah . Postdoc F : Ah . Professor D : Wow . PhD B : It 's very difficult if you try {disfmarker} while you 're trying , say , to convince somebody on the phone it 's difficult not to move your hands . Not {disfmarker} You know , if you watch people they 'll actually do these things . Professor D : Mm - hmm ? PhD B : So . I still think we should try a {disfmarker} a meeting or two with the blindfolds , at least of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of Grad H : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Um , maybe for part of the meeting , we don't have to do it the whole meeting . Professor D : Yeah , I think th I think it 's a great idea . PhD B : That could be fun . It 'll be too hard to make barriers , I was thinking because they have to go all the way Professor D : W Yeah . PhD B : you know , I can see Chuck even if you put a barrier here . Grad H : Well , we could just turn out the lights . Postdoc F : Actually {pause} well also {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can say I made barr barriers for {disfmarker} so that {disfmarker} the {pause} stuff I was doing with Collin wha {pause} which {pause} just used , um {pause} this {pause} kind of foam board . PhD B : Y Yeah ? Postdoc F : R really inexpensive . You can {disfmarker} you can masking tape it together , these are {pause} you know , pretty l large partitions . Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : But then we also have these mikes , is the other thing I was thinking , so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb {pause} the sound , Postdoc F : It 's true , it would disturb the , um {pause} the {disfmarker} the long - range {disfmarker} Grad H : The acoustics . PhD B : um Professor D : Blindfolds would be good .","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions. The questions should be diverse and should ask about different aspects related to the document. No two questions should be asking about the same thing and each question should be a wh-question. Do not provide anything else other than generated questions separaterd by commas. Document: Grad H : Yeah, I've been playing with, um uh, using the close - talking mike to do {disfmarker} to try to figure out who's speaking. So my first attempt was just using thresholding and filtering, that we talked about {disfmarker} about two weeks ago, and so I played with that a little bit, and {vocalsound} it works O K, {pause} except that {pause} it's very sensitive to your choice of {vocalsound} your filter width and your {vocalsound} threshold. So if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone's talking and when they're not. But if you try to use the same paramenters on another speaker, it doesn't work anymore, even if you normalize it based on the absolute loudness. PhD B : But does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole meeting? Grad H : It does work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting. Um Pretty well. PhD A : How did you do it Adam? Grad H : Pretty well. How did I do it? PhD A : Yeah. Grad H : What do you mean? PhD A : I mean, wh what was the {disfmarker} Grad H : The algorithm was, uh take o every frame that's over the threshold, and then median - filter it, {vocalsound} and then look for runs. PhD A : Yeah. Mm - hmm. Grad H : So there was a minimum run length, PhD A : Every frame that's over what threshold? Grad H : so that {disfmarker} A threshold that you pick. PhD A : In terms of energy? Ah! Grad H : Yeah. PhD A : OK. Postdoc F : Say that again? Frame over fres threshold. Grad H : So you take a {disfmarker} each frame, and you compute the energy and if it's over the threshold you set it to one, and if it's under the threshold you set it to zero, {vocalsound} so now you have a bit stream {pause} of zeros and ones. Postdoc F : Hmm. OK. Grad H : And then I median - filtered that {vocalsound} using, um {pause} a fairly long {pause} filter length. Uh {pause} well, actually I guess depends on what you mean by long, you know, tenth of a second sorts of numbers. Um and that's to average out you know, pitch, you know, the pitch contours, and things like that. And then, uh looked for long runs. Postdoc F : OK Grad H : And that works O K, if you fil if you tune the filter parameters, if you tune {vocalsound} how long your median filter is and how high you're looking for your thresholds. PhD A : Did you ever try running the filter before you pick a threshold? Grad H : No. I certainly could though. But this was just I had the program mostly written already so it was easy to do. OK and then the other thing I did, was I took {vocalsound} Javier's speaker - change detector {disfmarker} acoustic - change detector, and I implemented that with the close - talking mikes, and {pause} unfortunately that's not working real well, and it looks like it's {disfmarker} the problem is {disfmarker} he does it in two passes, the first pass {vocalsound} is to find candidate places to do a break. And he does that using a neural net doing broad phone classification and he has the {vocalsound} the, uh {pause} one of the phone classes is silence. And so the possible breaks are where silence starts and ends. And then he has a second pass which is a modeling {disfmarker} a Gaussian mixture model. Um looking for {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} whether it improves or {disfmarker} or degrades to split at one of those particular places. And what looks like it's happening is that the {disfmarker} even on the close - talking mike the broad phone class classifier's doing a really bad job. PhD A : Who was it trained on? Grad H : Uh, I have no idea. PhD A : Hmm. Grad H : I don't remember. Does an do you remember, Morgan, was it Broadcast News? Professor D : I think so, yeah. Grad H : Um {pause} So, at any rate, my next attempt, {pause} which I'm in the midst of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the {vocalsound} uh, thresholding as the way of generating the candidates. Because one of the things that definitely happens is if you put the threshold low {vocalsound} you get lots of breaks. All of which are definitely acoustic events. They're definitely {vocalsound} someone talking. But, like, it could be someone who isn't the person here, but the person over there or it can be the person breathing. And then feeding that into the acoustic change detector. And so I think that might work. But, I haven't gotten very far on that. But all of this is close - talking mike, so it's, uh {pause} just {disfmarker} just trying to get some ground truth. PhD E : Only with eh uh, but eh I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think, eh when {disfmarker} when, y I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I saw the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the speech from PDA and, eh {pause} close {pause} {vocalsound} talker. I {disfmarker} I think the there is a {disfmarker} a great difference in the {disfmarker} in the signal. Grad H : Oh, absolutely. PhD E : Um but eh I {disfmarker} but eh I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean that eh eh {pause} in the {disfmarker} in the mixed file {vocalsound} you can find, uh {pause} zone with, eh {pause} great different, eh {pause} level of energy. Grad H : So {pause} s my intention for this is {disfmarker} is as an aide for ground truth. not {disfmarker} PhD E : Um {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I think for, eh {pause} algorithm based on energy, {pause} eh, that um h mmm, {disfmarker} more or less, eh, like eh {pause} eh, mmm, first sound energy detector. Grad H : Say it again? PhD E : eh nnn. When y you the detect the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the first at {disfmarker} at the end of {disfmarker} of the {vocalsound} detector of, ehm princ um. What is the {disfmarker} the name in English? the {disfmarker} the, mmm, {pause} {vocalsound} the de detector of, ehm of a word in the {disfmarker} in the s in {disfmarker} an isolated word in {disfmarker} in the background That, uh Grad H : I'm {disfmarker} I'm not sure what you're saying, can you try {disfmarker} PhD E : I mean that when {disfmarker} when you use, eh {pause} eh {pause} any PhD A : I think he's saying the onset detector. PhD E : Yeah. Grad H : Onset detector, OK. PhD E : I {disfmarker} I think it's probably to work well eh, because, eh {pause} you have eh, in the mixed files a great level of energy. eh {pause} and great difference between the sp speaker. And probably is not so easy when you use the {disfmarker} the PDA, eh that {disfmarker} Because the signal is, eh {pause} the {disfmarker} in the e energy level. Grad H : Right. PhD E : in {disfmarker} in that, eh {pause} eh {pause} speech file {vocalsound} is, eh {pause} more similar. between the different eh, speaker, {vocalsound} um {pause} I {disfmarker} I think is {disfmarker} eh, it will {pause} i is my opinion. Grad H : Right. But different speakers. PhD E : It will be, eh {pause} more difficult to {disfmarker} to detect bass - tone energy. the {disfmarker} the change. I think that, um Grad H : Ah, in the clo in the P D A, you mean? PhD E : In the PDA. Grad H : Absolutely. PhD E : Yeah. Yeah. Grad H : Yeah, no question. It 'll be much harder. Professor D : Yeah. Grad H : Much harder. PhD E : And the {disfmarker} the another question, that when I review the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the work of Javier. I think the, nnn, the, nnn, {pause} that the idea of using a {pause} neural network {vocalsound} to {disfmarker} to get a broad class of phonetic, eh {pause} from, eh uh a candidate from the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the speech signal. If you have, eh {vocalsound} uh, I'm considering, only because Javier, eh {pause} only consider, eh {pause} like candidate, the, nnn, eh {pause} the silence, because it is the {disfmarker} the only model, eh {disfmarker} eh, he used that, eh {pause} {vocalsound} eh {pause} nnn, to detect the {disfmarker} the possibility of a {disfmarker} a change between the {disfmarker} between the speaker, Grad H : Right. PhD E : Um {pause} another {disfmarker} another research thing, different groups, eh {pause} working, eh {pause} on Broadcast News {vocalsound} prefer to, eh {pause} to consider hypothesis eh {pause} between each phoneme. Grad H : Mm - hmm. Yeah, when a {pause} phone changes. PhD E : Because, I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think it's more realistic that, uh {pause} only consider the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the silence between the speaker. Eh {pause} there {disfmarker} there exists eh {pause} silence between {disfmarker} between, eh {pause} a speaker. is {disfmarker} is, eh {pause} eh {pause} acoustic, eh {pause} event, important to {disfmarker} to consider. Professor D : Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. PhD E : I {disfmarker} I found that the, eh {pause} silence in {disfmarker} in many occasions in the {disfmarker} in the speech file, but, eh {pause} when you have, eh {pause} eh, two speakers together without enough silence between {disfmarker} between them, eh {pause} {vocalsound} I think eh {pause} is better to use the acoustic change detector basically and I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I IX or, mmm, BIC criterion for consider all the frames in my opinion. Professor D : Mm - hmm. Yeah, the {disfmarker} you know, the reason that he, uh {pause} just used silence {vocalsound} was not because he thought it was better, it was {disfmarker} it was {disfmarker} it was the place he was starting. PhD E : Yeah. Grad H : Yep. Professor D : So, he was trying to get something going, PhD E : Yeah. Professor D : and, uh e e you know, as {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as is in your case, if you're here for only a modest number of months you try to pick a realistic goal, PhD E : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Grad H : Do something. Professor D : But his {disfmarker} his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also. PhD E : Uh - huh. But, eh {pause} do {disfmarker} do you think that if you consider all the frames to apply {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the, eh {pause} the BIC criterion to detect the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the different acoustic change, {vocalsound} eh {pause} between speaker, without, uh {pause} with, uh {pause} silence or {vocalsound} with overlapping, uh, I think like {disfmarker} like, eh {pause} eh a general, eh {pause} eh {pause} way of process the {disfmarker} the acoustic change. Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD E : In a first step, I mean. Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD E : An - and then, eh {pause} {vocalsound} eh {pause} without considering the you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you, um {pause} you can consider the energy {vocalsound} like a another parameter in the {disfmarker} in the feature vector, eh. Grad H : Right. Absolutely. Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD E : This {disfmarker} this is the idea. And if, if you do that, eh {pause} eh, with a BIC uh criterion for example, or with another kind of, eh {pause} of distance in a first step, {vocalsound} and then you, eh {pause} you get the, eh {pause} the hypothesis to the {disfmarker} this change acoustic, {vocalsound} eh {pause} {vocalsound} to po process Grad H : Right. PhD E : Because, eh {pause} eh, probably you {disfmarker} you can find the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} eh {pause} a small gap of silence between speaker {vocalsound} with eh {pause} eh {pause} a ga mmm, {pause} {vocalsound} small duration Less than, {vocalsound} eh {pause} two hundred milliseconds for example Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD E : and apply another {disfmarker} another algorithm, another approach like, eh {pause} eh {pause} detector of ene, eh detector of bass - tone energy to {disfmarker} to consider that, eh {vocalsound} that, eh {pause} zone. of s a small silence between speaker, or {vocalsound} another algorithm to {disfmarker} to process, {vocalsound} eh {pause} the {disfmarker} the segment between marks eh {pause} founded by the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} the BIC criterion and applied for {disfmarker} for each frame. Professor D : Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. PhD E : I think is, eh {pause} nnn, it will be a an {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} a more general approach {vocalsound} the {pause} if we compare {disfmarker} with use, eh {pause} a neural net or another, eh {pause} speech recognizer with a broad class or {disfmarker} or narrow class, because, in my opinion eh {pause} it's in my opinion, {vocalsound} eh if you {disfmarker} if you change the condition of the speech, I mean, if you adjust to your algorithm with a mixed speech file and to, eh {vocalsound} to, eh {pause} {vocalsound} adapt the neural net, eh {pause} used by Javier with a mixed file. Professor D : Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. PhD E : uh With a m mixed file, Grad H : With the what file? PhD A : "" Mixed "". PhD E : with a {disfmarker} the mix, mix. Postdoc F : "" Mixed. "" Grad H : "" Mixed? "" Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD E : Sorry. And {pause} and then you {disfmarker} you, eh you try to {disfmarker} to apply that, eh, eh, eh, speech recognizer to that signal, to the Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"
17,"Professor F : Yeah . An - and the other thing is , I mean , in the unlikely event {disfmarker} and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way {disfmarker} in the unlikely event that we actually find {vocalsound} that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because , you know , there 's , you know , {vocalsound} all the stuff that {disfmarker} that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're {disfmarker} and they 're faster {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pipeline is faster than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , than the generation , um , eh , i in {disfmarker} in the day {disfmarker} e event that that day actually dawns , uh , I {disfmarker} I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do . Postdoc A : Oh , yes . Professor F : So I {disfmarker} I think {vocalsound} that , eh , eh , a as we were talking , if we {disfmarker} if we hire twelve , then we could , you know , run into a problem later . I mean , we also just couldn't sustain that forever . But {disfmarker} but , um {disfmarker} for all sorts of reasons {disfmarker} but if we hire f you know , f we have five on staff {disfmarker} five or six on staff at any given time , then {vocalsound} it 's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way . Postdoc A : Good . OK . Professor F : Good . PhD G : It 'd be great , too , if , um , we can {disfmarker} we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand {disfmarker} to experiment with , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , to have a ground truth for this segmentation work , which {disfmarker} I guess you have some already that was really helpful , and we could probably use more . PhD E : Mmm , yeah . That was a thing I {disfmarker} I planned working on , is , uh , to use the {disfmarker} the transcriptions which are done by now , and to {disfmarker} to use them as , uh {disfmarker} PhD G : Oh . Oh , the new ones PhD E : Yeah . PhD G : with the tighter boundaries . Yeah . PhD E : Yeah . And to use them for {disfmarker} for training a {disfmarker} or for {disfmarker} fo whatever . Yeah . To {disfmarker} to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them , and {disfmarker} Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that 's a thing w was {disfmarker} w what I 'm just looking into . PhD G : OK . Postdoc A : The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pre - segmentations are so much {disfmarker} are s so extremely helpful . Now there was , uh , I g guess {disfmarker} So , a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation {disfmarker} f for just very few days you were away . But it happened to be during that time I needed one , PhD E : Yeah . Postdoc A : so I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours and , um , they , um {disfmarker} you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available . And he 's , uh , usually , eh , uh , um {disfmarker} Um . So they really appreciate it . But I was gonna say that they do adjust it once in a while . You know , once in a while there 's something like , PhD E : Yeah , sure . Postdoc A : um , and e Actually you talked to them . Didn't you ? Did you ? Have you {disfmarker} ? PhD E : Yeah . I talked to Helen . Postdoc A : And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and she was {disfmarker} And so , I asked her {disfmarker} I mean , They 're very perceptive . I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers . I haven't done it yet , but I wanna do that and she 's out of town , um , for a couple of weeks , but I wanna do that when she returns . Um , cuz she was saying , you know , in a {disfmarker} in a span of very short period {disfmarker} we asked {disfmarker} It seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these things , and she was saying the short utterances , uh , the , um {disfmarker} PhD G : Hmm . PhD E : Mmm . Yeah . Postdoc A : you know , I mean , you 're {disfmarker} You 're aware of this . But {disfmarker} but actually i it 's so correct for so much of the time , that it 's an enormous time saver PhD E : Yeah . Postdoc A : and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries . So . PhD G : That 's great . Postdoc A : Um . Yeah . I think it 'd be interesting to combine these . PhD E : Yeah . PhD G : Is there actually a record of where they change ? I mean , you can compare , do a diff on the {disfmarker} just so that we {vocalsound} knew {disfmarker} Postdoc A : You could do it . It 's {disfmarker} it 's complicated in that {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} hhh , i hhh , i PhD E : Yeah . Actually , when {disfmarker} when they create new {disfmarker} yeah , new segments or something , it will be , uh , not that easy but {disfmarker} hmm . I think {pause} one could do that . PhD G : I mean , if we keep a old copy of the old time marks PhD E : Yeah . PhD G : just so that if we run it we know whether we 're {disfmarker} which ones were cheating PhD E : Yeah . Yeah . That would be great , yeah , to know that . PhD G : and Postdoc A : There is a {disfmarker} there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what I do is I merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version . PhD G : which one would be good . PhD E : Yeah . Postdoc A : So it 's not a pure {disfmarker} it 's not a pure condition . Wha - what you 'd really like is that they started with pre - segmented and were pre - segmented all the way through . PhD G : Mm - hmm . Postdoc A : And , um {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} {disfmarker} I , uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones . But , it will be possible in the future PhD E : Yeah . Postdoc A : because we {disfmarker} we 're , um . PhD E : It would . PhD G : Mmm , that 's great . PhD E : Yeah . PhD G : Yeah . As long as we have a record , I guess , of the original {pause} automatic one , we can always find out how well {pause} we would do fr from the recognition side by using those boundaries . PhD E : Yeah . Yeah . PhD G : Um . PhD E : Yeah . PhD G : You know , a completely non - cheating version . PhD E : Yeah . PhD G : Also if you need someone to record this meeting , I mean , I 'm happy to {disfmarker} for the transcribers {disfmarker} I could do it , or Chuck or Adam . Postdoc A : Thank you . Professor F : OK . So , uh , u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info ? PhD D : Yeah . So , um , uh , Jane and Adam and I had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the {pause} directory structure for all of the meeting {disfmarker} Professor F : Did you record it ? PhD D : No . For all the Meeting Recorder data . We should have . Um . And so we 've got a plan for what we 're gonna do there . And then , Jane also s prepared a {disfmarker} um , started getting all of the {disfmarker} the meetings organized , so she prepared a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a spreadsheet , which I spent the last couple of days adding to . So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far , and have been putting it into , uh , a spreadsheet {vocalsound} with start time , the date , the old meeting name , the new meeting name , the number of speakers , the duration of the meeting , comments , you know , what its transcription status is , all that kind of stuff . And so , the idea is that we can take this and then export it as HTML and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page so we can keep people updated about what 's going on . PhD G : Oh , great . PhD D : Um , I 've gotta get some more information from Jane cuz I have some {disfmarker} some gaps here that I need to get her to fill in , but {vocalsound} so far , um , {vocalsound} as of Monday , the fourteenth , um , we 've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected . And , um {disfmarker} Uh , some other interesting things , average number of speakers per meeting is six . Um , and I 'm gonna have on here the total amount that 's been transcribed so far , but I 've got a bunch of {disfmarker} uh , that 's what I have to talk to Jane about , figuring out exactly which ones have {disfmarker} have been completed and so forth . But , um , {vocalsound} this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the {disfmarker} the web site and people can {vocalsound} be informed of the status of various different ones . And {vocalsound} it 'll also list , uh , like under the status , if it 's at IBM or if it 's at ICSI , uh , or if it 's completed or which ones we 're excluding and {disfmarker} and there 's a place for comments , so we can , {vocalsound} um , say why we 're excluding things and so forth . So . Professor F : Now would the ones that , um , are already transcribed {disfmarker} we h we have enough there that c you know , we 've already done some studies and so forth and {disfmarker} um , shouldn't we go through and do the business - es u of {disfmarker} of having the , um , uh , participants approve it , uh , for {disfmarker} approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth ? Postdoc A : Um , interesting idea . In principle , I {disfmarker} I would say yes , although I still am doing some {disfmarker} the final - pass editing , trying to convert it over to the master file as the {disfmarker} being the channelized version and it 's {disfmarker} Yeah , it seems like I get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes {comment} and I have to stop . Cleaning up the things like the , uh , uh , places where the transcriber was uncertain , and {disfmarker} and doing spot - checking here and there . So , um , uh , I guess it would make sense to wait until th that 's done , um , but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Professor F : Well , le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} as I did with the , uh , uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pipeline . Postdoc A : Yeah . Professor F : Um , we are gonna have this DARPA {pause} meeting in the middle of July , Postdoc A : Yes . Professor F : and I think it w it 'd be {disfmarker} given that we 've been {disfmarker} we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available . Um . Postdoc A : It 'll certainly be done by then . Yeah . Professor F : Right . So we can s we {disfmarker} we wanna be able to say "" here is a subset that is available right now "" Postdoc A : Mm - hmm . That 's right . Professor F : and that 's has been through the legal issues and so forth . Postdoc A : That 's right . Professor F : So . Postdoc A : Yeah . That 's right . So that {disfmarker} Professor F : OK ? Postdoc A : OK . Professor F : So , by {disfmarker} before July . PhD C : And they don't have to approve , you know , th an edited version , they can just give their approval to whatever version Postdoc A : Well , maybe {disfmarker} Professor F : Well , in principle , yes . But , I mean , i if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we PhD C : Bu Yeah . But th I mean , the editing will continue . Presumably if {disfmarker} if s errors are found , they will be fixed , but they won't change the {disfmarker} the content of the meetings . PhD D : Content , really . Postdoc A : Well , see , this is the {disfmarker} this is the issue . Subtleties . PhD C : So . PhD G : Well , i if Jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ? Postdoc A : The other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ {comment} could 've been transcribed in the other way . Professor F : Yeah . PhD G : Thing {disfmarker} Postdoc A : And no and they wouldn't have {vocalsound} been slanderous if it had been this other word . You know ? Professor F : I it {disfmarker} you know , there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark . Right ? And you don't {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} there 's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody "" do you approve this , uh , you know {disfmarker} this document now ?

Do not provide anything else other than generated questions separaterd by commas. Document: Professor F : Yeah. An - and the other thing is, I mean, in the unlikely event {disfmarker} and since we're so far from this, it's a little hard to plan this way {disfmarker} in the unlikely event that we actually find {vocalsound} that we have, uh, transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because, you know, there's, you know, {vocalsound} all the stuff that {disfmarker} that was sitting there has been transcribed and they're {disfmarker} and they're faster {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pipeline is faster than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh, than the generation, um, eh, i in {disfmarker} in the day {disfmarker} e event that that day actually dawns, uh, I {disfmarker} I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do. Postdoc A : Oh, yes. Professor F : So I {disfmarker} I think {vocalsound} that, eh, eh, a as we were talking, if we {disfmarker} if we hire twelve, then we could, you know, run into a problem later. I mean, we also just couldn't sustain that forever. But {disfmarker} but, um {disfmarker} for all sorts of reasons {disfmarker} but if we hire f you know, f we have five on staff {disfmarker} five or six on staff at any given time, then {vocalsound} it's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way. Postdoc A : Good. OK. Professor F : Good. PhD G : It 'd be great, too, if, um, we can {disfmarker} we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand {disfmarker} to experiment with, um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know, to have a ground truth for this segmentation work, which {disfmarker} I guess you have some already that was really helpful, and we could probably use more. PhD E : Mmm, yeah. That was a thing I {disfmarker} I planned working on, is, uh, to use the {disfmarker} the transcriptions which are done by now, and to {disfmarker} to use them as, uh {disfmarker} PhD G : Oh. Oh, the new ones PhD E : Yeah. PhD G : with the tighter boundaries. Yeah. PhD E : Yeah. And to use them for {disfmarker} for training a {disfmarker} or for {disfmarker} fo whatever. Yeah. To {disfmarker} to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them, and {disfmarker} Yeah, but that {disfmarker} that's a thing w was {disfmarker} w what I'm just looking into. PhD G : OK. Postdoc A : The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pre - segmentations are so much {disfmarker} are s so extremely helpful. Now there was, uh, I g guess {disfmarker} So, a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation {disfmarker} f for just very few days you were away. But it happened to be during that time I needed one, PhD E : Yeah. Postdoc A : so I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours and, um, they, um {disfmarker} you know, they always appreciate that when they have that available. And he's, uh, usually, eh, uh, um {disfmarker} Um. So they really appreciate it. But I was gonna say that they do adjust it once in a while. You know, once in a while there's something like, PhD E : Yeah, sure. Postdoc A : um, and e Actually you talked to them. Didn't you? Did you? Have you {disfmarker}? PhD E : Yeah. I talked to Helen. Postdoc A : And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and she was {disfmarker} And so, I asked her {disfmarker} I mean, They're very perceptive. I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers. I haven't done it yet, but I wanna do that and she's out of town, um, for a couple of weeks, but I wanna do that when she returns. Um, cuz she was saying, you know, in a {disfmarker} in a span of very short period {disfmarker} we asked {disfmarker} It seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these things, and she was saying the short utterances, uh, the, um {disfmarker} PhD G : Hmm. PhD E : Mmm. Yeah. Postdoc A : you know, I mean, you're {disfmarker} You're aware of this. But {disfmarker} but actually i it's so correct for so much of the time, that it's an enormous time saver PhD E : Yeah. Postdoc A : and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries. So. PhD G : That's great. Postdoc A : Um. Yeah. I think it 'd be interesting to combine these. PhD E : Yeah. PhD G : Is there actually a record of where they change? I mean, you can compare, do a diff on the {disfmarker} just so that we {vocalsound} knew {disfmarker} Postdoc A : You could do it. It's {disfmarker} it's complicated in that {vocalsound} um, {vocalsound} hhh, i hhh, i PhD E : Yeah. Actually, when {disfmarker} when they create new {disfmarker} yeah, new segments or something, it will be, uh, not that easy but {disfmarker} hmm. I think {pause} one could do that. PhD G : I mean, if we keep a old copy of the old time marks PhD E : Yeah. PhD G : just so that if we run it we know whether we're {disfmarker} which ones were cheating PhD E : Yeah. Yeah. That would be great, yeah, to know that. PhD G : and Postdoc A : There is a {disfmarker} there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what I do is I merge what they've done with the pre - segmented version. PhD G : which one would be good. PhD E : Yeah. Postdoc A : So it's not a pure {disfmarker} it's not a pure condition. Wha - what you 'd really like is that they started with pre - segmented and were pre - segmented all the way through. PhD G : Mm - hmm. Postdoc A : And, um {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} {disfmarker} I, uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones. But, it will be possible in the future PhD E : Yeah. Postdoc A : because we {disfmarker} we're, um. PhD E : It would. PhD G : Mmm, that's great. PhD E : Yeah. PhD G : Yeah. As long as we have a record, I guess, of the original {pause} automatic one, we can always find out how well {pause} we would do fr from the recognition side by using those boundaries. PhD E : Yeah. Yeah. PhD G : Um. PhD E : Yeah. PhD G : You know, a completely non - cheating version. PhD E : Yeah. PhD G : Also if you need someone to record this meeting, I mean, I'm happy to {disfmarker} for the transcribers {disfmarker} I could do it, or Chuck or Adam. Postdoc A : Thank you. Professor F : OK. So, uh, u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info? PhD D : Yeah. So, um, uh, Jane and Adam and I had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the {pause} directory structure for all of the meeting {disfmarker} Professor F : Did you record it? PhD D : No. For all the Meeting Recorder data. We should have. Um. And so we've got a plan for what we're gonna do there. And then, Jane also s prepared a {disfmarker} um, started getting all of the {disfmarker} the meetings organized, so she prepared a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a spreadsheet, which I spent the last couple of days adding to. So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far, and have been putting it into, uh, a spreadsheet {vocalsound} with start time, the date, the old meeting name, the new meeting name, the number of speakers, the duration of the meeting, comments, you know, what its transcription status is, all that kind of stuff. And so, the idea is that we can take this and then export it as HTML and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page so we can keep people updated about what's going on. PhD G : Oh, great. PhD D : Um, I've gotta get some more information from Jane cuz I have some {disfmarker} some gaps here that I need to get her to fill in, but {vocalsound} so far, um, {vocalsound} as of Monday, the fourteenth, um, we've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected. And, um {disfmarker} Uh, some other interesting things, average number of speakers per meeting is six. Um, and I'm gonna have on here the total amount that's been transcribed so far, but I've got a bunch of {disfmarker} uh, that's what I have to talk to Jane about, figuring out exactly which ones have {disfmarker} have been completed and so forth. But, um, {vocalsound} this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the {disfmarker} the web site and people can {vocalsound} be informed of the status of various different ones. And {vocalsound} it 'll also list, uh, like under the status, if it's at IBM or if it's at ICSI, uh, or if it's completed or which ones we're excluding and {disfmarker} and there's a place for comments, so we can, {vocalsound} um, say why we're excluding things and so forth. So. Professor F : Now would the ones that, um, are already transcribed {disfmarker} we h we have enough there that c you know, we've already done some studies and so forth and {disfmarker} um, shouldn't we go through and do the business - es u of {disfmarker} of having the, um, uh, participants approve it, uh, for {disfmarker} approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth? Postdoc A : Um, interesting idea. In principle, I {disfmarker} I would say yes, although I still am doing some {disfmarker} the final - pass editing, trying to convert it over to the master file as the {disfmarker} being the channelized version and it's {disfmarker} Yeah, it seems like I get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes {comment} and I have to stop. Cleaning up the things like the, uh, uh, places where the transcriber was uncertain, and {disfmarker} and doing spot - checking here and there. So, um, uh, I guess it would make sense to wait until th that's done, um, but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Professor F : Well, le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} as I did with the, uh, uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pipeline. Postdoc A : Yeah. Professor F : Um, we are gonna have this DARPA {pause} meeting in the middle of July, Postdoc A : Yes. Professor F : and I think it w it 'd be {disfmarker} given that we've been {disfmarker} we've given a couple public talks about it already, spaced by months and months, I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available. Um. Postdoc A : It 'll certainly be done by then. Yeah. Professor F : Right. So we can s we {disfmarker} we wanna be able to say "" here is a subset that is available right now "" Postdoc A : Mm - hmm. That's right. Professor F : and that's has been through the legal issues and so forth. Postdoc A : That's right. Professor F : So. Postdoc A : Yeah. That's right. So that {disfmarker} Professor F : OK? Postdoc A : OK. Professor F : So, by {disfmarker} before July. PhD C : And they don't have to approve, you know, th an edited version, they can just give their approval to whatever version Postdoc A : Well, maybe {disfmarker} Professor F : Well, in principle, yes. But, I mean, i if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we PhD C : Bu Yeah. But th I mean, the editing will continue. Presumably if {disfmarker} if s errors are found, they will be fixed, but they won't change the {disfmarker} the content of the meetings. PhD D : Content, really. Postdoc A : Well, see, this is the {disfmarker} this is the issue. Subtleties. PhD C : So. PhD G : Well, i if Jane is clarifying question question, then, you know, how can they agree to it before they know her final version? Postdoc A : The other thing, too, is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word, which @ @ {comment} could've been transcribed in the other way. Professor F : Yeah. PhD G : Thing {disfmarker} Postdoc A : And no and they wouldn't have {vocalsound} been slanderous if it had been this other word. You know? Professor F : I it {disfmarker} you know, there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous because, you know, you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say, you know, that should be a period and not a question mark. Right? And you don't {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} there's no way that we're gonna go back and ask everybody "" do you approve this, uh, you know {disfmarker} this document now? "" So {disfmarker} So I think what it is is that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing that they sign {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I haven't looked at it in a while, but it has to be open enough that it sort of says "" OK, from now on {disfmarker} you know, now that I've read this, you can use {disfmarker} do anything you want with these data. "" Postdoc A : Mm - hmm. Professor F : And, uh {disfmarker} But, i I think we wanna {disfmarker} So, assuming that it's in that kind of wording, which I don't remember, {vocalsound} um, I think i we just wanna have enough confidence ourselves that it's so close to the final form it's gonna be in, a year from now that they're {disfmarker} Postdoc A : Mm - hmm. I agree. Mmm. I totally agree. It's just, uh, a question of, {vocalsound} uh, if {disfmarker} if the person is using the transcript as the way of them judging what they said and whether it was slanderous, {vocalsound} then it seems like it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} i it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them re - listening to the meeting.

Grad F : Yeah, it's a little bit {disfmarker} it's a little bit different. Right? So {disfmarker} Or maybe that's like a restrictive, non - restrictive {disfmarker} Grad E : Yeah. Grad F : you know, it's like it gets into that kind of thing for {disfmarker} um, but maybe I'm mixing, you know {disfmarker} this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence. Grad E : Mm - hmm. Grad F : So you might imagine that the information you pass to, you know {disfmarker} in identifying a particular referent would be, "" oh, some {disfmarker} "" you know, "" it's a guy and it's someone I know from school "". Grad E : Yeah. Grad F : So maybe that would, you know, be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the, whatever, construal engine or whatever, discourse context, to find {disfmarker} you know, either create this reference, Grad E : Mm - hmm. Grad F : in which case it 'd be created here, and {disfmarker} you know, so {disfmarker} so you could imagine that this might not {disfmarker} So, uh, I'm uncommitted to a couple of these things. Grad A : But {disfmarker} to make it m precise at least in my mind, uh, it's not precise. Grad F : Um. Grad A : So "" house "" is gender neuter? In reality Grad F : Um, it could be in {disfmarker} Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"
33,"Grad F : and that 's just what I used to generate the order . of these particular ones . PhD D : Oh ! Great . Great . Professor C : So , I 'm impressed by what we could do , Is take the standard training set for TI - digits , train up with whatever , you know , great features we think we have , uh for instance , and then test on uh this test set . Grad F : Um {disfmarker} Professor C : And presumably uh it should do reasonably well on that , and then , presumably , we should go to the distant mike , and it should do poorly . PhD D : Yeah . Professor C : And then we should get really smart over the next year or two , and it {disfmarker} that should get better . Grad F : Right . And inc increase it by one or two percent , yeah . Professor C : Yeah , {vocalsound} Yeah . Grad F : Um , but , in order to do that we need to extract out the actual digits . Professor C : Right . Grad F : Um , so that {disfmarker} the reason it 's not just a transcript is that there 're false starts , and misreads , and miscues and things like that . And so I have a set of scripts and X Waves where you just select the portion , hit R , um , it tells you what the next one should be , and you just look for that . You know , so it {disfmarker} it 'll put on the screen , "" The next set is six nine , nine two two "" . And you find that , and , hit the key and it records it in a file in a particular format . Professor C : So is this {disfmarker} Grad F : And so the {disfmarker} the question is , should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it ? Well , some of us . I 've been do I 've done , eight meetings , something like that , just by hand . Just myself , rather . So it will not take long . Um {disfmarker} Professor C : Uh , what {disfmarker} what do you think ? Postdoc B : My feeling is that we discussed this right before coffee and I think it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a fine idea partly because , um , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them . And also it is contributing to the , uh , c composition of the transcript cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it 'll be a more complete transcript . So I 'm {disfmarker} I think it 's fine , that part . Grad F : There is {disfmarker} there is {disfmarker} Professor C : So you think it 's fine to have the transcribers do it ? Postdoc B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Yeah , OK . Grad F : There 's one other small bit , which is just entering the information which at s which is at the top of this form , onto the computer , to go along with the {disfmarker} where the digits are recorded automatically . PhD D : Good . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : And so it 's just , you know , typing in name , times {disfmarker} time , date , and so on . Um , which again either they can do , but it is , you know , firing up an editor , or , again , I can do . Or someone else can do . Postdoc B : And , that , you know , I 'm not , that {disfmarker} that one I 'm not so sure if it 's into the {disfmarker} the , things that , I , wanted to use the hours for , because the , the time that they 'd be spending doing that they wouldn't be able to be putting more words on . Professor C : Mmm . Postdoc B : But that 's really your choice , it 's your {disfmarker} PhD D : So are these two separate tasks that can happen ? Or do they have to happen at the same time before {disfmarker} Grad F : No they don't have {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} you have to enter the data before , you do the second task , but they don't have to happen at the same time . PhD D : OK . Grad F : So it 's {disfmarker} it 's just I have a file whi which has this information on it , and then when you start using my scripts , for extracting the times , it adds the times at the bottom of the file . And so , um , I mean , it 's easy to create the files and leave them blank , and so actually we could do it in either order . PhD D : Oh , OK . Grad F : Um , it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double - check , to make sure you 're entering for the right person . But , either way . Professor C : Yeah . Yeah just by way of uh , uh , a uh , order of magnitude , uh , um , we 've been working with this Aurora , uh data set . And , uh , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , uh , is about , uh {disfmarker} I think the best score was something like five percent , uh , error , per digit . PhD A : Per digit . Professor C : So , that {disfmarker} Grad F : Per digit . Professor C : You 're right . So if you were doing {pause} ten digit , uh , recognition , {vocalsound} you would really be in trouble . So {disfmarker} So the {disfmarker} The point there , and this is uh car noise uh , uh things , but {disfmarker} but real {disfmarker} real situation , PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : well , "" real "" , Um , the {disfmarker} uh there 's one microphone that 's close , that they have as {disfmarker} as this sort of thing , close versus distant . Uh but in a car , instead of {disfmarker} instead of having a projector noise it 's {disfmarker} it 's car noise . Uh but it wasn't artificially added to get some {disfmarker} some artificial signal - to - noise ratio . It was just people driving around in a car . So , that 's {disfmarker} that 's an indication , uh that was with , many sites competing , and this was the very best score and so forth , so . More typical numbers like PhD D : Although the models weren't , that good , right ? I mean , the models are pretty crappy ? Professor C : You 're right . I think that we could have done better on the models , but the thing is that we got {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this is the kind of typical number , for all of the , uh , uh , things in this task , all of the , um , languages . And so I {disfmarker} I think we 'd probably {disfmarker} the models would be better in some than in others . Um , so , uh . Anyway , just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you 're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard . PhD D : Hmm . Postdoc B : Hmm . It 's gonna be fun to see how we , compare at this . Very exciting . s @ @ . Professor C : Yeah . PhD D : How did we do on the TI - digits ? Grad F : Well the prosodics are so much different s it 's gonna be , strange . I mean the prosodics are not the same as TI - digits , for example . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how much of effect that will have . PhD D : H how do {disfmarker} PhD G : What do you mean , the prosodics ? Grad F : Um , just what we were talking about with grouping . That with these , the grouping , there 's no grouping at all , and so it 's just {disfmarker} the only sort of discontinuity you have is at the beginning and the end . PhD G : So what are they doing in Aurora , are they reading actual phone numbers , Grad F : Aurora I don't know . I don't know what they do in Aurora . PhD G : or , a {disfmarker} a digit at a time , or {disfmarker} ? Professor C : Uh , I 'm not sure how {disfmarker} PhD G : Cuz it 's {disfmarker} Professor C : no , no I mean it 's connected {disfmarker} it 's connected , uh , digits , PhD G : Connected . Professor C : yeah . But . Grad F : But {disfmarker} Right . PhD G : So there 's also the {disfmarker} not just the prosody but the cross {disfmarker} the cross - word modeling is probably quite different . PhD D : H How Grad F : But in TI - digits , they 're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that , PhD G : Right . PhD D : do we do on TI - digits ? Grad F : so it 's gonna be different . I don't remember . I mean , very good , right ? Professor C : Yeah , I mean we were in the . Grad F : One and a half percent , two percent , something like that ? Professor C : Uh , I th no I think we got under a percent , but it was {disfmarker} but it 's {disfmarker} but I mean . The very best system that I saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at {disfmarker} at Bell Labs , or . Uh , but . But , uh , sort of pulling out all the stops . Grad F : Oh really ? Postdoc B : s @ @ . It s strikes me that there are more {disfmarker} each of them is more informative because it 's so , random , Grad F : OK . Alright . PhD D : Hmm . Professor C : But I think a lot of systems sort of get half a percent , or three - quarters a percent , Grad F : Right . Professor C : and we 're {disfmarker} we 're in there somewhere . Grad F : But that {disfmarker} I mean it 's really {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's close - talking mikes , no noise , clean signal , just digits , I mean , every everything is good .

PhD G : It 's like the , single cell , you know , it 's the beginning of life , PhD D : Pre - prehistory . PhD G : yeah . Grad F : And it 's still like an order of magnitude worse than what humans do . PhD G : Right . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : So . Professor C : When {disfmarker} When they 're wide awake , yeah . Um , Grad F : Yeah . After coffee . Professor C : after coffee , you 're right . Not after lunch . Grad F : OK , so , um , what I 'll do then is I 'll go ahead and enter , this data . And then , hand off to Jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits . Professor C : Yeah . Yeah . One question I have that {disfmarker} that I mean , we wouldn't know the answer to now but might , do some guessing , but I was talking before about doing some model modeling of arti uh , uh , marking of articulatory , features , with overlap and so on . Grad F : Hmm . Professor C : And , and , um , On some subset . One thought might be to do this uh , on {disfmarker} on the digits , or some piece of the digits . Uh , it 'd be easier , uh , and so forth . The only thing is I 'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena , in w i i The reason for doing it is because the {disfmarker} the argument is that certainly with conversational speech , the stuff that we 've looked at here before , um , just doing the simple mapping , from , um , the phone , to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book , uh , isn't right .

And you do this gross thing saying "" Well I guess it 's this phone starting there "" . So , uh , that 's the reasoning . But , It could be that when we 're reading digits , because it 's {disfmarker} it 's for such a limited set , that maybe {disfmarker} maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much . I don't know . Di - an anybody {disfmarker} ? {pause} Do you have any {disfmarker} ? {pause} Anybody have any opinion about that , Postdoc B : and that people might articulate more , and you that might end up with more {disfmarker} a closer correspondence .

37,"Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus (CharlesbourgHaute-Saint-Charles, CPC) : Thank you, Mr.Chair. Although we are right in the middle of a pandemic and the government has agreed to set aside all parliamentary business in order to concentrate solely on eliminating the virus in Canada and its impacts, the Prime Minister is deceiving Canadians by introducing measures to punish law-abiding firearm owners. Why? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister) : Mr.Chair, I feel that all Canadians were affected by the massacre in Nova Scotia. Once again, too many families are facing tragedy and tremendous grief. During the last election campaign, we promised to ban military-style assault weapons, and that is exactly what we have done. We will be working with members from all parties in order to continue strengthening gun control. It is a shame that, once more, the Conservatives do not want to strengthen gun control in the country. Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus : Mr.Chair, I understand the Prime Minister's reply. However, I would like to know whether he considers that, with this order in council, organized crime, street gangs and other criminals are simply going to turn in their weapons. Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : This is indeed only a first step, but it is an important one. We are doing other things to eliminate or restrict handguns in our municipalities, to strengthen the control at our borders, and to implement other measures. I am pleased to hear the hon. member speak of those measures, because we are going to work together in the House to strengthen gun control. I hope that the Conservative Party will be part of that discussion in a positive way, in order to keep Canadians safe. Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus : Mr.Chair, I can simply say to the Prime Minister that the Conservative Party has always been committed to battling criminals, not law-abiding citizens. Speaking of criminals, we know that, even before the pandemic, the Prime Minister had asked the Parole Board of Canada to release prisoners more easily and more quickly. Now we are learning that, because of the pandemic, some releases are happening very quickly. The Minister of Public Safety told us that the people were approaching the end of their sentences or were older, but we are learning in the media that some dangerous criminals are being released. Can the Prime Minister give us an explanation? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : The protection, the safety and the health of all Canadians are important for the government. This is why we have taken additional measures in our correctional services to ensure that guards and inmates are protected. We have indeed opened the doors to some more speedy releases, but only in very specific cases that present little or no danger for Canadians. We have managed to find the right balance. We must protect Canadians and we must also ensure that they are safe. Those two things go hand-in-hand. Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus : So is the Prime Minister confirming to us that no dangerous criminals have been precipitously released so that they do not have to experience COVID-19 within the walls? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : There are very strict rules and principles to ensure that people posing a threat to society are not released. The Chair : Mr.Paul-Hus, you have one minute left.

Although we are right in the middle of a pandemic and the government has agreed to set aside all parliamentary business in order to concentrate solely on eliminating the virus in Canada and its impacts, the Prime Minister is deceiving Canadians by introducing measures to punish law-abiding firearm owners. Why? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister) : Mr.Chair, I feel that all Canadians were affected by the massacre in Nova Scotia. Once again, too many families are facing tragedy and tremendous grief. During the last election campaign, we promised to ban military-style assault weapons, and that is exactly what we have done. We will be working with members from all parties in order to continue strengthening gun control. It is a shame that, once more, the Conservatives do not want to strengthen gun control in the country.

46,"PhD F : the question I had about queries was , um , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? Are {disfmarker} are we gonna try and o Grad G : We {disfmarker} we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? PhD F : Yeah . Well , I mean , Grad G : And so that was one suggestion . PhD F : so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ? I mean , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , Professor D : Mmm . PhD F : so that it may not be a feasible thing . But {disfmarker} PhD E : Hello . Dan here . PhD F : n PhD B : Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : I mean , this is an issue that goes a little bit beyond where {pause} we are right now . PhD E : OK . PhD B : They 're the expert PhD E : Mari ? Professor A : Yeah ? PhD E : Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . Is someone picking you up ? Professor A : Um , {vocalsound} what 's our schedule ? Professor D : Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz . Professor A : Let 's see , you and I need dis Uh , no , we did the Liz talk . Professor D : And you and I need to Oh , oh . You already did the Liz talk . Professor A : Yeah . So {disfmarker} so that was the prosody thing . Professor D : OK . PhD B : We - {vocalsound} I don't remember it . Professor A : Um , we need to finish the {disfmarker} Professor D : Oh , OK . Professor A : It 's already four - fifteen . PhD B : I have like no recall memory . Professor A : Uh , after . Professor D : Yeah . Professor A : We need to {pause} finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . So , Grad G : And what ? Professor A : um {disfmarker} Professor D : I 'm at your disposal . So , up to you . Professor A : Um , what {disfmarker} what 's the plan for this discussion ? We should {disfmarker} Professor D : Um , I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ? Grad G : At least . Yeah . Professor A : Uh , less . Grad G : m i Even if that much ? Professor A : Yeah . Professor D : Less ? Grad G : Less . Professor A : So , I think {disfmarker} PhD B : It 's interesting that he 's got , like , {pause} this discussion free Professor D : Well , I mean , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . Professor A : Action {disfmarker} Yeah .  So , PhD B : yet it 's separate . Professor D : And {disfmarker} Professor A : e e why don't you say five - thirty ? I don't {disfmarker} PhD E : OK , five - thirty . Professor A : Is that OK ? We 'll probably hit horrible traffic . PhD E : Sounds {disfmarker} OK . h Thanks , bye . Professor A : That 's not a lot of time , PhD E : That 's that . Professor A : but {disfmarker} Professor D : Yeah . Grad G : Well , in answer to "" is it Landay 's problem ? "" , um , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . So he has very little manpower . Um , there 's very little allocated for him and also he 's pretty focused on user interface . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff . Professor D : Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things but it can't be , yeah , very deep . u I {disfmarker} I actually think that {disfmarker} that , uh , again , just as a bootstrap , {comment} if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} with queries , uh , could at least give {disfmarker} give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know . I mean , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area , and {disfmarker} the people are talking about and {disfmarker} and , uh {disfmarker} PhD B : But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . That 's what I 'm worried about . So you might as well just give him the summaries . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : And {disfmarker} Professor D : Maybe . PhD F : Well , I 'm not sure {disfmarker} I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . Grad G : y Well , but I think {disfmarker} PhD B : Oh , OK . PhD F : Right ? Of how to {disfmarker} how to generate queries from a {disfmarker} PhD B : How to do this from the summary . Professor D : Yeah . Grad G : I , uh {disfmarker} PhD F : That was sort of what my {pause} question was {pause} aimed towards . PhD B : So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , uh , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . There 's no way that can happen . Are we gonna later go over it Professor A : Hmm . Professor D : Right . Grad G : Right . PhD B : and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or {disfmarker} or a deeper {disfmarker} Yeah . I mean {disfmarker} Grad G : Or {disfmarker} or just a memory refresher . PhD B : But that 's done off {disfmarker} they have to do that off - line . Grad G : Yep . I agree . PhD B : You Postdoc H : I 'm also wondering if we could ask the {disfmarker} the people a {disfmarker} a question which would be "" what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? "" Becau - in terms of like informativeness , PhD B : That 's a good one . Postdoc H : it might be , you know , that the summary would {disfmarker} would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . Professor D : I would think that would be the most likely thing . PhD B : Dan doesn't know what sex he is . PhD E : Yeah , really . Professor A : But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . Postdoc H : I think you get two different types of information . Professor A : You get two {disfmarker} Yeah , that 's true . PhD E : Yeah . Postdoc H : Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the {disfmarker} what the meeting was about . Professor D : Hey . PhD B : Ah Professor D : Yeah . Grad G : We 're still here . Postdoc H : So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about {pause} with the summary . But with the "" what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? "" {disfmarker} Uh , so the fact that , uh , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting PhD B : Going to see the kids . PhD E : You {disfmarker} you can keep it on . Postdoc H : and that {disfmarker} and that Dan worked on {disfmarker} on that . So I thought that was really {disfmarker} you know . So , I mean , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings Professor A : Mm - hmm . Postdoc H : but could be very informative . Professor A : Yeah , that 's actually a really good idea . Postdoc H : I think it wouldn't be too , uh , uh , cost - intensive either . You know , I mean , it 's like something someone can do pretty easily on the spur of the moment . Professor C : Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? Grad G : As many are willing to do it . Professor C : Make it a voluntary thing , PhD E : Yeah . Cuz you 'll get {disfmarker} cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? Professor C : and then {disfmarker} Yeah . That 's why I was wondering . PhD E : So {disfmarker} Grad G : Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . But , uh , people could , like , listen to them a little bit and {pause} generate some queries . Postdoc H : Yeah . Grad G : Of course Jane doesn't need to . I 'm sure you have that meeting memorized by now . PhD E : Yeah . Professor A : But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say {pause} what was the most interesting thing you learned , Grad G : Mmm . Postdoc H : Yeah . Yeah . Professor A : for those pe people willing to stay . Postdoc H : And that {disfmarker} I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some of the little things that would be hidden . Professor A : And {disfmarker} and that might be something people are willing to stay for . Professor D : Boy , I {disfmarker} I don't know how we get at this {disfmarker} Postdoc H : That would be interesting . Professor C : Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something Grad G : Or want to get up and leave . Professor C : and then you go around the room and they say "" yeah , me too , I agree . "" Grad G : Me too , me too , me too . Professor D : Yeah . Professor A : That 's fine . Professor C : So {disfmarker} PhD E : On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? Professor D : Well {disfmarker} PhD E : They might say "" oh , I was gonna say that one but now I have to think of something else "" . Grad G : Well , you have the other thing , that {disfmarker} that they know why we 're doing it . We 'll {disfmarker} I mean , we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is {disfmarker} is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say . Professor D : It 's gonna take some thought . I mean , It seemed {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The kind of , uh , interest that I had in this thing initially was , uh , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else {pause} later , Professor A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : and you want to pick up something from this meeting related to the something else . So it 's really the imp the {disfmarker} the list of what 's important 's in the something else Professor A : Right . Professor D : rather than the {disfmarker} PhD E : Mmm . Professor D : And it might be something minor {disfmarker} of minor importance to the meeting . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad G : Right . Professor D : Uh , in fact if {disfmarker} if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and check on it even . So it 's {disfmarker} it 's that you 're trying to find {disfmarker} {comment} You 're {disfmarker} you 've now {disfmarker} You weren't interested {disfmarker} Say I {disfmarker} I said "" well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person "" . PhD E : Right . Professor D : But {disfmarker} but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm "" well what is {disfmarker} what was that part that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that , uh , Mari was saying ? "" Grad G : Yeah , like Jim Bass says "" add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf "" Professor A : Uh {disfmarker} Professor D : Yeah . Yeah . Professor A : Yeah . Professor D : And then I 'm trying to fi I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's when I look {disfmarker} in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that {vocalsound} didn't really stick in my head the first time around and {disfmarker} but for some {comment} new reason I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm interested in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the old stuff . Grad G : But that {disfmarker} that 's gonna be very hard to generate . Professor A : Well , I {disfmarker} That 's hard to generate Professor D : So , I don't {disfmarker} I don't know . Professor C : Mm - hmm . PhD F : Do we {disfmarker} Professor A : and {disfmarker} and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times um , make {disfmarker} you know , think to myself "" this is interesting , Professor D : Mm - hmm . Professor A : I 've gotta come back and follow up on it "" . Professor D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor A : So , things that I think are interesting , um , I would be , uh , wanting to do a query about . And also , I like the idea of going around the room , because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it . PhD E : Hmm . Professor D : Yeah . That {disfmarker} that might get at some of what I was {disfmarker} I was concerned about , uh , being interested in something later that w uh , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , but some new {pause} task comes along that makes me want to look up . Grad G : But {disfmarker} But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . Professor D : Yeah . So having multiple people might get at some of that . Grad G : By {disfmarker} so by going around {disfmarker} Yeah . Professor D : Yeah . Grad G : Yeah , I {disfmarker} I think {pause} you can't get at all of it , Professor D : Yeah . Grad G : right ?

Professor D : Uh, in fact if {disfmarker} if it was really major, if it's the thing that really stuck in your head, then you might not need to go back and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and check on it even. So it's {disfmarker} it's that you're trying to find {disfmarker} {comment} You're {disfmarker} you've now {disfmarker} You weren't interested {disfmarker} Say I {disfmarker} I said "" well, I wasn't that much interested in dialogue, I'm more of an acoustics person "". PhD E : Right. Professor D : But {disfmarker} but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue, and I'm "" well what is {disfmarker} what was that part that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that, uh, Mari was saying? "" Grad G : Yeah, like Jim Bass says "" add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf "" Professor A : Uh {disfmarker} Professor D : Yeah. Yeah. Professor A : Yeah. Professor D : And then I'm trying to fi I mean, that's {disfmarker} that's when I look {disfmarker} in general when I look things up most, is when it's something that {vocalsound} didn't really stick in my head the first time around and {disfmarker} but for some {comment} new reason I'm {disfmarker} I'm {disfmarker} I'm interested in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the old stuff. Grad G : But that {disfmarker} that's gonna be very hard to generate. Professor A : Well, I {disfmarker} That's hard to generate Professor D : So, I don't {disfmarker} I don't know. Professor C : Mm - hmm. PhD F : Do we {disfmarker} Professor A : and {disfmarker} and I think that's half of what i I would use it for. But I also a lot of times um, make {disfmarker} you know, think to myself "" this is interesting, Professor D : Mm - hmm. Professor A : I've gotta come back and follow up on it "". Professor D : Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Professor A : So, things that I think are interesting, um, I would be, uh, wanting to do a query about. And also, I like the idea of going around the room, because if somebody else thought something was interesting, I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it. PhD E : Hmm. Professor D : Yeah. That {disfmarker} that might get at some of what I was {disfmarker} I was concerned about, uh, being interested in something later that w uh, I didn't consider to be important the first time, which for me is actually the dominant thing, because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't, but some new {pause} task comes along that makes me want to look up. Grad G : But {disfmarker} But what's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you. Professor D : Yeah. So having multiple people might get at some of that. Grad G : By {disfmarker} so by going around {disfmarker} Yeah. Professor D : Yeah. Grad G : Yeah, I {disfmarker} I think {pause} you can't get at all of it, Professor D : Yeah. Grad G : right?

82,"Professor B : Yeah . But another way of looking at it {vocalsound} might be that {disfmarker} I mean , what w we we are coming up with feature sets after all . So another way of looking at it is that {vocalsound} um , the mel cepstru mel {pause} spectrum , mel cepstrum , {vocalsound} any of these variants , um , give you the smooth spectrum . It 's the spectral envelope . By going back to the FFT , {vocalsound} you 're getting something that is {pause} more like the raw data . So the question is , what characterization {disfmarker} and you 're playing around with this {disfmarker} another way of looking at it is what characterization {vocalsound} of the difference between {pause} the raw data {pause} and this smooth version {pause} is something that you 're missing that could help ? So , I mean , looking at different statistical measures of that difference , coming up with some things and just trying them out and seeing if you add them onto the feature vector does that make things better or worse in noise , where you 're really just i i the way I 'm looking at it is not so much you 're trying to f find the best {disfmarker} the world 's best voiced - unvoiced , uh , uh , classifier , PhD C : Mm - hmm . PhD A : Mmm . Professor B : but it 's more that , {vocalsound} you know , uh , uh , try some different statistical characterizations of that difference back to the raw data PhD C : Right .

Professor B : So , what I 'm saying is maybe that 's not a killer because you 're just getting some characterization , one that 's driven by your intuition about voiced - unvoiced certainly , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : but it 's just some characterization {vocalsound} of something back in the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the almost raw data , rather than the smooth version . PhD A : Mm - hmm .

I am going to keep talking about the area of jurisdiction that the Prime Minister likes to talk about, except that I want to point out the incompetence of the Liberals in keeping their commitments on infrastructure projects. My question is very simple. As the provinces gradually restart their economies, can the Prime Minister tell us how many projects that the provinces have submitted are waiting for approval from his government?

My department has worked very hard to approve projects, and we will continue to do so. It is very important to build projects that will create good jobs The Chair : We are returning to Mr.Berthold. Mr. Luc Berthold : We still haven't had a response. How many projects are currently awaiting government approval? I know that the minister has been meeting virtually with the provinces over the last few days. However, there are still hundreds of projects waiting for approval from the Liberal government. Rather than wait for the right political opportunity to approve these files, will the minister commit today to respecting the provinces and approving by next week all the projects that are sitting on her desk? Hon. Catherine McKenna : Mr.Chair, I'm pleased with how we are working with the provinces and territories. We are approving projects. If the hon. member speaks to the provinces and territories, he will see how well we are working together. We will announce the approval of projects because it's very important for our economy, our communities and creating good jobs. Mr. Luc Berthold : Does the minister understand that she hasn't told us how many projects are still pending? The construction season is very short. Approval of a project in July means that work can't begin until next year, which won't help revive our economy. Hon. Catherine McKenna : I want to make it clear that we have approved hundreds of projects in the last few weeks.

Catherine McKenna (Minister of Infrastructure and Communities) : I'm sorry, Mr.Chair, I was on mute. I'm very pleased with how we are working with the provinces and territories. I have spoken with all of my provincial and territorial counterparts over the last couple of weeks. Work on our historic infrastructure program is progressing well. My department has worked very hard to approve projects, and we will continue to do so. It is very important to build projects that will create good jobs The Chair : We are returning to Mr.Berthold. Mr. Luc Berthold : We still haven't had a response. How many projects are currently awaiting government approval? I know that the minister has been meeting virtually with the provinces over the last few days. However, there are still hundreds of projects waiting for approval from the Liberal government. Rather than wait for the right political opportunity to approve these files, will the minister commit today to respecting the provinces and approving by next week all the projects that are sitting on her desk? Hon. Catherine McKenna : Mr.Chair, I'm pleased with how we are working with the provinces and territories. We are approving projects. If the hon. member speaks to the provinces and territories, he will see how well we are working together. We will announce the approval of projects because it's very important for our economy, our communities and creating good jobs. Mr. Luc Berthold : Does the minister understand that she hasn't told us how many projects are still pending? The construction season is very short. Approval of a project in July means that work can't begin until next year, which won't help revive our economy. Hon. Catherine McKenna : I want to make it clear that we have approved hundreds of projects in the last few weeks. We will work with the provinces, territories, municipalities and indigenous communities to implement these projects. These projects are important for the economy and the environment, as well as for jobs Questions: |eot_id|>assistantassistant

163,"PhD C : Mmm {disfmarker} Yeah . Then , uh , whhh well , I 've been working on {disfmarker} on t mainly on on - line normalization this week . Uh , I 've been trying different {disfmarker} slightly {disfmarker} slightly different approaches . Um , the first thing is trying to play a little bit again with the , um , time constant . Uh , second thing is , uh , the training of , uh , on - line normalization with two different means , one mean for the silence and one for the speech . Um , and so I have two recursions which are controlled by the , um , probability of the voice activity detector . Mmm . This actually don't s doesn't seem to help , although it doesn't hurt . So . But {disfmarker} well , both {pause} on - line normalization approach seems equivalent . Well , they {disfmarker} PhD F : Are the means pretty different {pause} for the two ? PhD C : Yeah . They can be very different . Yeah . Mm - hmm . PhD F : Hmm . Professor B : So do you maybe make errors in different places ? Different kinds of errors ? PhD C : I didn't look , uh , more closely . Um . It might be , yeah . Mm - hmm . Um . Well , eh , there is one thing that we can observe , is that the mean are more different for {disfmarker} for C - zero and C - one than for the other coefficients . And {disfmarker} Yeah . And {disfmarker} Yeah , it {disfmarker} the C - one is {disfmarker} There are strange {disfmarker} strange thing happening with C - one , is that when you have different kind of noises , the mean for the {disfmarker} the silence portion is {disfmarker} can be different . And {disfmarker} PhD F : Hmm . PhD C : So when you look at the trajectory of C - one , it 's {disfmarker} has a strange shape and I was expecting th the s that these two mean helps , especially because of the {disfmarker} the strange C - ze C - one shape , uh , which can {disfmarker} like , yo you can have , um , a trajectory for the speech and then when you are in the silence it goes somewhere , but if the noise is different it goes somewhere else . PhD F : Oh . PhD C : So which would mean that if we estimate the mean based on all the signal , even though we have frame dropping , but we don't frame ev uh , drop everything , but {disfmarker} uh , this can {disfmarker} hurts the estimation of the mean for speech , and {disfmarker} Mmm . {comment} But I still have to investigate further , I think . Um , a third thing is , um , {vocalsound} that instead of t having a fixed time constant , I try to have a time constant that 's smaller at the beginning of the utterances to adapt more quickly to the r something that 's closer to the right mean . T t um {disfmarker} Yeah . And then this time constant increases and I have a threshold that {disfmarker} Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD C : well , if it 's higher than a certain threshold , I keep it to this threshold to still , uh , adapt , um , the mean when {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if the utterance is , uh , long enough to {disfmarker} to continue to adapt after , like , one second Professor B : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD C : or {disfmarker} Mmm . Uh , well , this doesn't help neither , but this doesn't hurt . So , well . It seems pretty {disfmarker} PhD F : Wasn't there some experiment you were gonna try where you did something differently for each , um , {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} I don't know whether it was each mel band or each , uh , um , FFT bin or someth There was something you were gonna {disfmarker} uh , {comment} some parameter you were gonna vary depending on the frequency . I don't know if that was {disfmarker} PhD C : I guess it was {disfmarker} I don't know . No . u Maybe it 's this {disfmarker} this idea of having different {pause} on - line normalization , um , tunings for the different MFCC 's . PhD F : For each , uh {disfmarker} Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD C : But {disfmarker} Mm - hmm . PhD F : Yeah . I {disfmarker} I thought , Morgan , you brought it up a couple meetings ago . And then it was something about , uh , some and then somebody said "" yeah , it does seem like , you know , C - zero is the one that 's , you know , the major one "" or , uh , s I can't remember exactly what it was now . PhD C : Mmm . Yeah . There {disfmarker} uh , actually , yeah . S um , it 's very important to normalize C - zero and {pause} much less to normalize the other coefficients . And , um , actu uh , well , at least with the current on - line normalization scheme . And we {disfmarker} I think , we {vocalsound} kind of know that normalizing C - one doesn't help with the current scheme . And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} Yeah . In my idea , I {disfmarker} I was thinking that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the reason is maybe because of these funny things that happen between speech and silence which have different means . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . But maybe it 's not so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so easy to {disfmarker} Professor B : Um , I I really would like to suggest looking , um , a little bit at the kinds of errors . I know you can get lost in that and go forever and not see too much , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sometimes , PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : but {disfmarker} but , um , just seeing that each of these things didn't make things better may not be enough . It may be that they 're making them better in some ways and worse in others , PhD C : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Professor B : or increasing insertions and decreasing deletions , or {disfmarker} or , um , um , you know , helping with noisy case but hurting in quiet case . And if you saw that then maybe you {disfmarker} it would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} something would occur to you of how to deal with that . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD D : Hmm . PhD C : Alright . Mmm . Yeah . W um , So that 's it , I think , for the on - line normalization . Um {disfmarker} Yeah . I 've been playing a little bit with some kind of thresholding , and , mmm , as a first experiment , I think I Yeah . Well , what I did is t is to take , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to measure the average {disfmarker} no , the maximum energy of s each utterance and then put a threshold {disfmarker} Well , this for each mel band . Then put a threshold that 's fifteen DB below {disfmarker} well , uh , a couple of DB below this maximum , Professor B : Mm - hmm . Mmm . PhD C : and {disfmarker} Actually it was not a threshold , it was just adding noise . Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD C : So I was adding a white noise energy , uh , that 's fifteen DB below the maximum energy of the utterance . And {disfmarker} Yeah . When we look at {disfmarker} at the , um , MFCC that result from this , they are {pause} a lot more smoother . Um , when we compare , like , a channel zero and channel one utterance {disfmarker} um , so a clean and , uh , the same noisy utterance {disfmarker} well , there is almost no difference between the cepstral coefficients of the two . PhD F : Hmm . PhD C : Um . And {disfmarker} Yeah . And the result that we have in term of speech recognition , actually it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not worse , it 's not better neither , but it 's , um , kind of surprising that it 's not worse PhD F : Hmm . PhD C : because basically you add noise that 's fifteen DB {disfmarker} just fifteen DB below {pause} the maximum energy . Grad A : Sorry . PhD C : And at least {disfmarker} PhD F : So why does that m {pause} smooth things out ? I don't {disfmarker} I don't understand that . Professor B : Well , there 's less difference . Right ? PhD C : It 's {disfmarker} I think , it 's whitening {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} the portion that are more silent , Professor B : Cuz it 's {disfmarker} PhD C : as you add a white noise that are {disfmarker} has a very high energy , it whitens everything PhD F : Huh . Oh , OK . PhD C : and {disfmarker} and the high - energy portion of the speech don't get much affected anyway by the other noise . And as the noise you add is the same is {disfmarker} {pause} the shape , it 's also the same . PhD F : Hmm . Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : So they have {disfmarker} the trajectory are very , very similar . And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} Professor B : So , I mean , again , if you trained in one kind of noise and tested in the same kind of noise , you 'd {disfmarker} you know , given enough training data you don't do b do badly . The reason that we d that we have the problems we have is because {pause} it 's different in training and test . Even if {vocalsound} the general kind is the same , the exact instances are different . And {disfmarker} and PhD F : Mm - hmm . Professor B : so when you whiten it , then it 's like you {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the only noise {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to first order , the only th noise that you have is white noise and you 've added the same thing to training and test . PhD F : Mm - hmm . Professor B : So it 's , PhD F : Hmm . Professor B : uh {disfmarker} PhD F : So would that {pause} be similar to , like , doing the smoothing , then , over time or {disfmarker} ? PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : Well , it 's a kind of smoothing , PhD C : I think it 's {disfmarker} I think it 's different . Professor B : but {disfmarker} PhD C : It 's {disfmarker} it 's something that {disfmarker} yeah , that affects more or less the silence portions because {disfmarker} PhD F : Mm - hmm . PhD C : Well , anyway , the sp the portion of speech that ha have high energy are not ch a lot affected by the noises in the Aurora database . Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD C : If {disfmarker} if you compare th the two shut channels of SpeechDat - Car during speech portion , it 's n n n the MFCC are not very different . They are very different when energy 's lower , like during fricatives or during speech pauses . And , Professor B : Yeah , but you 're still getting more recognition errors , PhD C : uh {disfmarker} Professor B : which means {vocalsound} that the differences , even though they look like they 're not so big , {vocalsound} are {disfmarker} are hurting your recognition .

And so then we would just stop it . Um And , uh , one of the things {disfmarker} I don't remember the details on , but I remember at some point , when you were working with a second stream , and you tried a low - pass filtering to cepstrum , in some case you got {disfmarker} PhD E : MSG Yeah .

190,"Gareth Pierce : I think that the evidence is that different learners see their requirements differently. And I agree that a textbook is part of the picture that should be available. But I think the evidence also shows that not every young person will use them; perhaps the teacher uses them. There is an emphasis, for example, from one pupil there, on that traditional model of revision, namely class notes and his own revision notes, but that he personally also wanted a textbook. So, certainly, the content of a textbook is going to be important, and that that's available in some form or other. It was very interesting to know, for example, that when he was describing the traditional model of revision, he felt that he'd had quite a lot of the content of the textbook through the classroom notes. Much of that digital content, of course, corresponds to the content areas of a textbook, but it's just in a different form. But, in general, there should be a textbook. And some of our frustration as well is that the timetables of some individual publishers don't always get us to the point where there is a textbook available in time. That doesn't happen so often in English medium, but we know about that gap in time in the Welsh provision. Darren Millar AM : Well, it's happened fairly regularly in the English-medium textbook world, hasn't it? My daughter—she featured in that video—has got her RS qualifications coming up, and she only had a textbook over the Easter period. I mean, it's completely unacceptable. And many others in that video are also being affected. You mentioned digital resources; not everybody's got access to digital resources in their own homes, even, in Wales. So, aren't we giving a significant disadvantage to those learners who might need the traditional 'swotting up from a textbook' method of revision and benefit from that? Mike Ebbsworth : We do ensure that those digital resources include things that the teachers can also print. Most of these are resources for teachers so that the teachers can adapt them for their own use, to suit the learners who are in front of them at any given time. But certainly there are materials there. If there are activities, then those activities can be printed off and handed to pupils so that they can take them home. So, I would be sceptical about that comment. We are thinking of the totality, ultimately. Gareth Pierce : I think you're right that the availability of technology is an important part of this big picture. The young people talk about websites and blogs, and we're talking about digital resources, so being able to reach those resources, I think, is vital in Wales. It's interesting to note two contradictory remarks from the teaching associations in the letters. One praises what's available digitally, whereas another teaching organisation sees this as more work for teachers. As Mike said, we've created those resources that can be adapted. One teaching organisation says that it just creates more work, while another organisation says that the digital resource is something that's very valuable. Of course, the headteacher at the end was praising the fact that, in a situation of crisis or unacceptable timetables, we have succeeded in creating some resources that will be in the textbook later, but available digitally at an early stage. But I agree with your core comment that technology is vital, and access to that, and also the content of a textbook in some form is vital as well. Darren Millar AM : Mr Blaker, you would agree that a textbook should be an essential core piece of the resource pack available for each qualification. Philip Blaker : I think we wouldn't want to underplay the desirability of textbooks, recognising that different learners have different learning styles and may look to different resources. I think what I'd like to raise is a wider concern about textbooks in their current model, which is very much around the fact that every time there's a change in a specification, there's a new textbook, which is designed around that specification and is endorsed by an awarding body, which is a nice model for a publisher, because every time there's a change, there's an opportunity for a new textbook. There are two concerns that I'd like to raise on that. First, the focus on teaching and learning. Ofsted and also Estyn have raised concerns about the focus in teaching on teaching to the test as a common concern in both nations. I have a concern that having a textbook that is endorsed by the awarding body and is designed specifically around that specification may lead to some of that tendency. And also, there's the sustainability of the model. We know that we're about to go into another round of reforms associated with the curriculum change. That's going to lead to another round of textbooks that may need to be focused on qualifications. I think I'd much rather see that textbooks are seen as a curriculum resource that are broader than, perhaps, the model of endorsement and the current model of publication suggest. Darren Millar AM : So, you don't think that a textbook for each subject should be a core resource for pupils who are learning in advance of examinations. Emyr George : I'd just like to pick you up on that. I think a textbook for each subject is absolutely an essential part of the broad range of resources that you'd want to see available for people to choose what they prefer, but on a subject, perhaps, rather than a specific specification, because I think there's a tendency to conflate the two, and much of the underlying content that is assessed in one specification, or a new updated specification, will remain unchanged. It is true that there may be a different focus or emphasis, or a different style of questioning, but that can be picked up more nimbly through supplementary digital resources, for example, which can highlight that change, particularly to a teacher, so that they can shape their lesson planning around that. What we are looking at here are reformed GCSEs and reformed A-levels in subjects that are well-established, traditional subjects, and so whilst it is not necessarily the ideal, I think it's important to remember that there is already a good deal of pre-existing resources, including textbooks, out there in schools already. We're not for a moment saying that that is the situation that we would want everybody to be in. I think it might be preferable if the textbook was perfectly bespoke to the course and didn't contain any extraneous material, but that perhaps is an ideal picture and I think we do need to remember that there are already many resources out there that are available to teachers and to students. Darren Millar AM : But of course, unlike their peers in perhaps other parts of the UK, we have teachers who are having to go meticulously through some of these other resources that might be available to determine whether they're appropriate for use in the classroom, given that the specification is different in terms of the new qualifications. Can I just ask you about the disadvantage that some learners might face as a result of the lack of textbooks? Mr Blaker, I note that you sought to reassure the committee in some of your opening remarks about the fact that equivalent outcomes are what you aim to achieve in discussion with the WJEC in terms of the outcome of assessments, and I think that that's a very positive thing. But, how do you differentiate between the different learning styles of individual students who are in that cohort to ensure that the disadvantage that one faces because they're somebody who relies particularly heavily on textbook-type learning, traditional sort of swotting up for examinations, versus someone who is much more digitally aware and able to use digital resources—? How do you make sure that it's fair to the cohort as a whole, while still enabling some of these individuals for whom textbooks are important not to face disadvantage within that cohort? Philip Blaker : The systems that are in place are very much around making sure that awarding is fair across the whole cohort. It's very difficult—in fact, it would be impossible—to unpick all of the different factors that might affect performance, because you could well have a textbook that's been available for some time, it may be somebody's preferred leaning style to use a textbook, but did they use that textbook effectively? You know, did they open it in revision or did they not open it in revision? So, there are so many different factors that can affect individual performance. I think it's impossible to unpick a particular aspect like the availability of resources. Motivation would be one thing, an individual learner's motivation in the subject. The biggest input would be the quality of teaching. I think evidence has been provided to you by the regional consortia, which we saw yesterday. They particularly wanted to stress this point I think; that the quality of teaching is probably the most dominant and the most important factor in relation to a learner's ultimate performance in the examination. Darren Millar AM : I understand that, but you also understand that someone who doesn't have the resources that they feel are best suited to them face some element of a greater disadvantage than others for whom, perhaps, textbooks are less important. Gareth Pierce : I think also, perhaps, related to that, it is important to mention digital literacy here. Every young person in Wales, I would hope, taking GCSE or A-level, should have that digital literacy in order to source the valuable materials available—that they should have those skills. Then, they have the choice whether they go down the digital route, or do they do as Mike suggested—much of the digital material can be printed—or do they then turn to textbooks, in the hope that those would be available? That would then allow for a pupil's personal learning choice to be reflected. It's also important for teachers to confirm that their ways of teaching do support these alternative approaches taken by pupils. Not every pupil will choose to learn or revise in exactly the same way. So, the flexibility for the pupil is very important, I think. Darren Millar AM : I understand that, but I've got people in my constituency who haven't even got a broadband link at home, so there's a digital disadvantage as well. Can I just ask you about the reason why this has taking so long to sort out? It was back in 2015 that concerns were first raised about the availability of textbooks in both English and Welsh for the new qualifications. We're three years on, what on earth has been happening in the interim and why is it taking so long? If you've got these resources digitally, why can't they just be compounded into textbooks pretty straightforwardly? Gareth Pierce : I think the main reason for that is that there are three series of reforms of qualifications that have happened. There were some in 2015, other subjects in 2016, and other subjects in 2017. Those three cycles of reform have all suffered from the short timetable that was between approving a qualification and publishers being able to start the work. Perhaps an interesting comparison would be a subject being taught for the first time in 2015—where that subject has reached now in terms of resources. I would hope that each one of those subjects have more available now in terms of resources, and therefore we are adding each year—not textbooks but digital resources. There are more past papers available, of course. We are working on sample work at the request of teachers. So, every subject is moving on over a period of time of five to six years while that specification is being studied. But those same difficulties have, unfortunately, affected 2015 subjects and 2017 subjects, and that's why we're discussing the same thing in 2018. Darren Millar AM : So, it's the scale of the challenge and the volume of the work? Gareth Pierce : Yes.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} I've {disfmarker} User Interface : So you've also got um {disfmarker} you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . Um {disfmarker} Marketing : I just love you tech guys , huh . Industrial Designer : Yeah there's a thingy and a dingy and {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} You press this and it does th User Interface : Well {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah y do jabber {vocalsound} User Interface : so you've got {disfmarker} here's here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal , Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : um you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board . Um you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot {vocalsound} . Project Manager : {vocalsound} I dunno who and whatnot . User Interface : So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} exactly . Industrial Designer : Nah . User Interface : So um we've got a {disfmarker} i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here , this is a eighteen pin um uh chip {vocalsound} I dunno . Marketing : P Yeah . User Interface : Uh it's two double A_ batteries . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : This is pretty standard remote . So here are options for our power sources . You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , um {vocalsound} th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that . Project Manager : {vocalsound} 'Kay . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I wanna change that {vocalsound} . User Interface : I don't know if that's really {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} I I gotta I gotta flashlight , and uh {disfmarker} User Interface : I don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : You shake it . Marketing : yeah but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this {vocalsound} . User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Like this {vocalsound} . User Interface : So that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy , Marketing : And that's on the camera {vocalsound} . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it {vocalsound} . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : 'Kay . User Interface : Uh we've got solar cells , which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night {vocalsound} which doesn't make a lot of sense . Project Manager : Mm 'kay . User Interface : And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea . Project Manager : Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ? User Interface : M battery versus cradle I think is {disfmarker} yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : I like the kinetic . Project Manager : So we have battery versus cradle {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Marketing : I g I I figured you would . Yes . {vocalsound} Yeah . User Interface : It could be fun {vocalsound} . Project Manager : It's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty , just to be actually serious for a minute here , User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : you could {disfmarker} User Interface : Well it is it is more uh {disfmarker} I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle . So um Project Manager : Mm . Hmm . User Interface : our case design . We have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium . If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and uh {disfmarker} Yeah pers Project Manager : Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it . User Interface : I think wood i {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} It it it {disfmarker} Project Manager : Nah . User Interface : I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , you know . Marketing : Uh . Project Manager : Okay . Hmm . Marketing : Uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative . We can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever {disfmarker} whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it . User Interface : Right . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : And what we may be able to do , and I think this might be the best option is to combine some {disfmarker} a couple of these . Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a {disfmarker} to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic . Project Manager : 'Kay . Do you get a good grip on the rubber ? Yeah okay . {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah um {disfmarker} Marketing : And if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : You don't even need to lean down to get it . User Interface : The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is {disfmarker} w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . So um {disfmarker} and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um {disfmarker} Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : But basically these are {vocalsound} curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department , in their um {vocalsound} in their {vocalsound} message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . I have no idea exactly what they're talking about , Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : but that's what they told me , {vocalsound} uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : I would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , where it's curved on m m multiple axes , right ? I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : or surfaces . I have no idea . Project Manager : I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a {disfmarker} Marketing : Mm-hmm yeah that's {disfmarker} yeah that's what I see . Project Manager : yeah that's what {gap} . User Interface : Oh okay oh like a wave , okay . Marketing : Yeah that's what I see also . User Interface : Alright that makes sense okay . Um okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and L_C_D_ display , Marketing : Ooh . User Interface : or multiple scrolling wheels . Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh {disfmarker} has at his disposal to put together a user interface . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : For electronics , we have these very technical um {vocalsound} descriptions here . A simple chip , which is the least expensive , but I have no numbers to give you , Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : a regular chip , which is {vocalsound} like the medium porridge {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} medium expense uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ? User Interface : Yes the difference is , with a simple chip {disfmarker} a simple chip will operate {disfmarker} oh why doesn't this scroll up ? Previous previous , okay . A simple chip is required to operate push buttons . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Um {vocalsound} an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display , and it didn't say specifically , but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : So but yeah . Project Manager : Yeah that makes sense . So presentation from {disfmarker} I guess design would go best . Next . User Interface : That's the end of my presentation . Project Manager : Technical functions or interface concept ? User Interface : I think {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Oh interface concept . Project Manager : Yeah that's it . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Very long presentation . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yes , but it has your name on it . User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} User Interface : That I would believe . Industrial Designer : about {disfmarker} Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that . Somehow . Um so {vocalsound} the the {disfmarker} what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without {disfmarker} with a l a less complicated um design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext . Project Manager : So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ? Industrial Designer : Ye no it's not User Interface : That's not a scroll wheel . Industrial Designer : i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross , Project Manager : Nah . Oh okay okay . I see . Industrial Designer : so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that {gap} alone . User Interface : Right . Project Manager : Uh , okay . User Interface : Instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized , so something looks good Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : and uh is not too prone to get lost . That be it . Project Manager : 'Kay . So on to {disfmarker} Y functional requirements or trend watching ? Marketing : I dunno . User Interface : Trend watching has a later date there . Marketing : Trend watching I guess . Trend watching I believe . Project Manager : {gap} forty six nineteen fifty seven . Yep . Marketing : See what it looks like . It's been so long . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {gap} . Marketing : Well {vocalsound} I don't know what to say . When I s when I see the {disfmarker} when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it . I see so many of 'em out there . There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there . User Interface : Are you talking about the picture ? That's not our that's not our b design , Marketing : Yeah yeah . User Interface : that's just a {disfmarker} that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like . Marketing : Okay . Okay . Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now . That's what I understand so , Project Manager : Upper management said yes . Marketing : hello . Project Manager : Uh e excuse that , that's a bit of spam . Marketing : And and so {disfmarker} yeah I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that I'm gonna market ? Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand . Uh I like the idea of of the scroll makin {vocalsound} there are so many people making these products at this price right now . What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique ? User Interface : What's special and unique about a scroll ? Marketing : Uh {vocalsound} well I don't {disfmarker} Project Manager : It's cool . Marketing : yeah it's {disfmarker} I I just see it as different . I don't say it's specially mm {disfmarker} I don't say it's special . Uh I say that it's different I {disfmarker} what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price . I need something to market about this thing . We're we're a new firm . Project Manager : I'd I'd say though that we {disfmarker} if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well , Marketing : What i {vocalsound} if when when we have {disfmarker} Project Manager : but wi with a similar {disfmarker} Marketing : yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's {disfmarker} as as a marketing standard {disfmarker} I need something to market , to make this product unique . User Interface : Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the {disfmarker} having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , Marketing : Yep . User Interface : having it look really nice um and also be really durable . Marketing : Mm 'kay . Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here . Project Manager : Mm . Course . User Interface : Right yeah . Yeah . Marketing : And and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now . Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . That's that is the next step , there's technology and then there is technology , which we're moving into the next phase . Project Manager : Yeah 'cause that's {gap} . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : And so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability . Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : So I need a product . Project Manager : Mm 'kay . User Interface : Well let's get a product then . Marketing : I need a product to market . And I just {disfmarker} whatever product you guys put together , we'll find a way to market it . Tha that I'm not concerned with . Project Manager : So now {disfmarker} Marketing : If you if you give me {disfmarker} if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost . Project Manager : So our big {vocalsound} questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? Do we go basic or do we go for features ? Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ? User Interface : Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? Function-wise , what does that do that {disfmarker} Project Manager : Oh but that was in your presentation {vocalsound} so wh what would you imagine it doing ? Marketing : Yeah wh wh what's the {vocalsound} wh User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm 'kay Industrial Designer : But would we {disfmarker} Marketing : Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : If it creates something more complex or more expensive , then I don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity . But again , from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co {vocalsound} it's a very competitive market . Project Manager : What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : So I d User Interface : Th they are gonna be more expensive , but on the other hand , I mean , it {disfmarker} I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know {disfmarker} if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use {disfmarker} if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . I don't think volume {disfmarker} or do you think volume would be {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : I dunno . I'll bet first in volume maybe . I dunno . User Interface : No we can {disfmarker} we can do multiple scroll wheels but {disfmarker} Project Manager : Well I d I like the idea of basically focusing the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the {vocalsound} uh dock to put it in {disfmarker} to to charge it . We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : It s i m makes it easy to market , Marketing : Yeah yeah . Project Manager : it's easy to differentiate the product , yeah so . Marketing : I think it's {disfmarker} that's right . I think so . Project Manager : And if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : So if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well {disfmarker} Marketing : Yep . I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness . Project Manager : So our big decision then is like how do we do um like {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have uh {disfmarker} What type of casing ? I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : I'm thinking {disfmarker} yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , where there's {disfmarker} you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused {disfmarker} the plastic with rubber on the outside . Project Manager : Okay . Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for {disfmarker} User Interface : {vocalsound} Well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens I think are are kind of {disfmarker} Project Manager : Okay . So then if we {vocalsound} {disfmarker} d d do we want to do anything more basic with the {disfmarker} uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for {vocalsound} um buttons , or do we want {disfmarker} if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ? Do we want to give {disfmarker} do we want to have anything else on it ? Industrial Designer : It's only a T_V_ . User Interface : Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing {disfmarker} I mean it's {disfmarker} you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you {vocalsound} just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information , you know , there . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : It receives no information . Industrial Designer : Hmm . User Interface : So I I don't see any reason for having an L_C_D_ 'cause it's an increased cost . Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it . Marketing : Yeah . Yeah right now there's {disfmarker} right now there's nothing coming out of the T_V_ to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the {disfmarker} a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the , User Interface : Right . Marketing : I don't see the necessity of an L_C_D_ either . Don't see it . Project Manager : Okay so the question is now I guess we need t to decide on {disfmarker} well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing . Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ? Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : What what overall things have we not decided on ? User Interface : Well we have to {disfmarker} I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . There's the scroll wheel , in or out ? What do you guys like in the user interface ? Project Manager : I think maybe in terms of marketing , is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost ? Marketing : {vocalsound} Again . Well I think it's it's {disfmarker} the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , I believe , for me to market . Uh again the push-buttons I I see are are everywhere . And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote . It's just another {disfmarker} it's just a an idea , and I don't know {disfmarker} User Interface : Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because {vocalsound} I think , as far as durability th it's not a big {disfmarker} well maybe when it's closed . Marketing : I mean what I see {disfmarker} one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , {vocalsound} their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : This {disfmarker} User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : And what I keep throwing out there {disfmarker} I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : But you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost . Project Manager : Yeah and I guess th th the question th {vocalsound} th that you're being asked right now is whether {disfmarker} is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? Marketing : Oh okay Project Manager : Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost . Marketing : phew . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness . I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features , User Interface : Well {disfmarker} Marketing : if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost . User Interface : The {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , which will {disfmarker} Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : That's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well ? User Interface : Um {vocalsound} we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine . Industrial Designer : No it's just different . User Interface : But we I we will need a receiver , an antenna . Marketing : Integrated , yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : So it's just uh I I think that's {disfmarker} User Interface : It should be a really simple signal though so {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control . Project Manager : And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep . User Interface : That's true yeah . Project Manager : But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need q quality , is it ? It's {disfmarker} User Interface : Oh yeah yeah . It'll be really cheap . Marketing : Or maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama , you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} You can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Maybe not {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Makes your living room more fresh as you watch {vocalsound} . Marketing : Yeah yeah yeah yeah . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Okay we're doing well for time here . Industrial Designer : S Project Manager : Um we've got about another ten minutes . I think that uh {disfmarker} User Interface : So the scroll wheel , in or out ? Project Manager : Mm pr my personal preference is out . I don't think the cost is justified {vocalsound} for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and I don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah I think we have {disfmarker} like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : 'cause it's it it breaks down easier . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that . Project Manager : But then that that surely d depends a little on the T_V_ Marketing : W Project Manager : because some T_V_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so {disfmarker} User Interface : Sure . Project Manager : if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the T_V_'s ability to to change channels . Or do you have to go through and you wait for it ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : {vocalsound} You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to {disfmarker} User Interface : Well I think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it's maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it's where it's quantized into you know certain {disfmarker} Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Project Manager : Uh I see I see . That's where you {disfmarker} User Interface : That was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Ah I see I see what you're talking about now . Okay . Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : It's just {disfmarker} it's basically {disfmarker} it it's just a f look and feel thing . It has the same exact functionality as two buttons . Marketing : {vocalsound} I I think there's {disfmarker} you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing {disfmarker} are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . Project Manager : Yeah if you're just sitting there going {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Marketing : Instead of going button-to-bu you just {vocalsound} j you'd j j j j j j . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : That's kinda cool actually . Marketing : I really I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing . Project Manager : I like that . User Interface : Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip . Marketing : Well there's ano Project Manager : Well not n necessarily . User Interface : But {disfmarker} Project Manager : You could basically make it so that it'll {disfmarker} I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once . User Interface : Right . Marketing : That's right . Project Manager : If you do that . User Interface : Yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , Project Manager : Other than click click click . Yeah . User Interface : but I think once people get used to it {disfmarker} I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though . Project Manager : And if we're marketing it as a high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good T_V_s as well , yeah , presumably . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Primarily . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah I think so . I I think so . Industrial Designer : Yep . Marketing : Now the the only thing I I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} on the interface side of it , is that {vocalsound} I I I see the dilemma . {vocalsound} But if we have the option of of scrolling {vocalsound} at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So I can go uh {vocalsound} presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . {vocalsound} I know what {disfmarker} because it's on the television . The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it . So {vocalsound} I don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . Okay ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm .","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

Um you've got {vocalsound} a printed {vocalsound} a printed uh circuit board here, and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber {vocalsound} nubbies into these little holes that activate {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : We've all broke a remote control ri um s yeah. {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah we've all broken a remote control. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} I've {disfmarker} User Interface : So you've also got um {disfmarker} you've got your chip here, your batteries here, and some sorta electronics. Um {disfmarker} Marketing : I just love you tech guys, huh. Industrial Designer : Yeah there's a thingy and a dingy and {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} You press this and it does th User Interface : Well {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah y do jabber {vocalsound} User Interface : so you've got {disfmarker} here's here's a transistor, and this amplifies your signal, Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : um you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board. Um you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot {vocalsound}. Project Manager : {vocalsound} I dunno who and whatnot. User Interface : So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} exactly. Industrial Designer : Nah. User Interface : So um we've got a {disfmarker} i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here, this is a eighteen pin um uh chip {vocalsound} I dunno. Marketing : P Yeah. User Interface : Uh it's two double A_ batteries. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : This is pretty standard remote. So here are options for our power sources. You can use a basic battery, which we've already discussed, um {vocalsound} th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that. Project Manager : {vocalsound} 'Kay. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I wanna change that {vocalsound}. User Interface : I don't know if that's really {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} I I gotta I gotta flashlight, and uh {disfmarker} User Interface : I don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : You shake it. Marketing : yeah but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this {vocalsound}. User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Like this {vocalsound}. User Interface : So that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy, Marketing : And that's on the camera {vocalsound}. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it {vocalsound}. Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : 'Kay. User Interface : Uh we've got solar cells, which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night {vocalsound} which doesn't make a lot of sense. Project Manager : Mm 'kay. User Interface : And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea. Project Manager : Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here? User Interface : M battery versus cradle I think is {disfmarker} yeah. Project Manager : Okay. Industrial Designer : I like the kinetic. Project Manager : So we have battery versus cradle {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Marketing : I g I I figured you would. Yes. {vocalsound} Yeah. User Interface : It could be fun {vocalsound}. Project Manager : It's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty, just to be actually serious for a minute here, User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : you could {disfmarker} User Interface : Well it is it is more uh {disfmarker} I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle. So um Project Manager : Mm. Hmm. User Interface : our case design. We have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do. Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic, a rubber latex type thing, uh wood, or titanium. If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium, and uh {disfmarker} Yeah pers Project Manager : Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche, wouldn't it. User Interface : I think wood i {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} It it it {disfmarker} Project Manager : Nah. User Interface : I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote, it's just anti-technology really, you know. Marketing : Uh. Project Manager : Okay. Hmm. Marketing : Uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative. We can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever {disfmarker} whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it. User Interface : Right. Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : And what we may be able to do, and I think this might be the best option is to combine some {disfmarker} a couple of these. Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell, to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a {disfmarker} to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable, and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic. Project Manager : 'Kay. Do you get a good grip on the rubber? Yeah okay. {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah um {disfmarker} Marketing : And if you make it from that super rubber, when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand. User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : You don't even need to lean down to get it. User Interface : The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is {disfmarker} w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want. So um {disfmarker} and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um {disfmarker} Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : But basically these are {vocalsound} curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department, in their um {vocalsound} in their {vocalsound} message to me, that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom. I have no idea exactly what they're talking about, Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : but that's what they told me, {vocalsound} uncurved, flat, curved, or double-curved. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : I would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved, where it's curved on m m multiple axes, right? I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : or surfaces. I have no idea. Project Manager : I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a {disfmarker} Marketing : Mm-hmm yeah that's {disfmarker} yeah that's what I see. Project Manager : yeah that's what {gap}. User Interface : Oh okay oh like a wave, okay. Marketing : Yeah that's what I see also. User Interface : Alright that makes sense okay. Um okay, with the interface we have the following options, we can u we can use push buttons, we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button, and L_C_D_ display, Marketing : Ooh. User Interface : or multiple scrolling wheels. Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh {disfmarker} has at his disposal to put together a user interface. Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : For electronics, we have these very technical um {vocalsound} descriptions here. A simple chip, which is the least expensive, but I have no numbers to give you, Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : a regular chip, which is {vocalsound} like the medium porridge {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} medium expense uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip? User Interface : Yes the difference is, with a simple chip {disfmarker} a simple chip will operate {disfmarker} oh why doesn't this scroll up? Previous previous, okay. A simple chip is required to operate push buttons. Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : Um {vocalsound} an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display, and it didn't say specifically, but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels. Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : So but yeah. Project Manager : Yeah that makes sense. So presentation from {disfmarker} I guess design would go best. Next. User Interface : That's the end of my presentation. Project Manager : Technical functions or interface concept? User Interface : I think {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Oh interface concept. Project Manager : Yeah that's it. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Very long presentation. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yes, but it has your name on it. User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} User Interface : That I would believe. Industrial Designer : about {disfmarker} Marketing : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : Mm. User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that. Somehow. Um so {vocalsound} the the {disfmarker} what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without {disfmarker} with a l a less complicated um design, so the numbers, the volume control, and channel control, and teletext access. Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial. User Interface : Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer : And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext. Project Manager : So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume? Industrial Designer : Ye no it's not User Interface : That's not a scroll wheel. Industrial Designer : i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross, Project Manager : Nah. Oh okay okay. I see. Industrial Designer : so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that {gap} alone. User Interface : Right. Project Manager : Uh, okay. User Interface : Instead of play, stop, rewind, and fast forward there, that's up, down, louder, and quieter. Project Manager : Okay. Industrial Designer : Yeah um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized, so something looks good Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : and uh is not too prone to get lost. That be it. Project Manager : 'Kay. So on to {disfmarker} Y functional requirements or trend watching? Marketing : I dunno. User Interface : Trend watching has a later date there. Marketing : Trend watching I guess. Trend watching I believe. Project Manager : {gap} forty six nineteen fifty seven. Yep. Marketing : See what it looks like. It's been so long. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {gap}. Marketing : Well {vocalsound} I don't know what to say. When I s when I see the {disfmarker} when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it. I see so many of 'em out there. There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there. User Interface : Are you talking about the picture? That's not our that's not our b design, Marketing : Yeah yeah. User Interface : that's just a {disfmarker} that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like. Marketing : Okay. Okay. Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet. Project Manager : Mm. Marketing : And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now. That's what I understand so, Project Manager : Upper management said yes. Marketing : hello. Project Manager : Uh e excuse that, that's a bit of spam. Marketing : And and so {disfmarker} yeah I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that I'm gonna market? Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand. Uh I like the idea of of the scroll makin {vocalsound} there are so many people making these products at this price right now. What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique? User Interface : What's special and unique about a scroll? Marketing : Uh {vocalsound} well I don't {disfmarker} Project Manager : It's cool. Marketing : yeah it's {disfmarker} I I just see it as different. I don't say it's specially mm {disfmarker} I don't say it's special. Uh I say that it's different I {disfmarker} what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different. I give me a lower price, give me a higher price, give me some new technology, don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price. I need something to market about this thing. We're we're a new firm. Project Manager : I'd I'd say though that we {disfmarker} if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though, the then we have that as well, Marketing : What i {vocalsound} if when when we have {disfmarker} Project Manager : but wi with a similar {disfmarker} Marketing : yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's {disfmarker} as as a marketing standard {disfmarker} I need something to market, to make this product unique. User Interface : Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the {disfmarker} having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior, Marketing : Yep. User Interface : having it look really nice um and also be really durable. Marketing : Mm 'kay. Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here. Project Manager : Mm. Course. User Interface : Right yeah. Yeah. Marketing : And and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle, when we have some kind of design, so what I'm saying is, from my perspective, I don't have a product to market right now. Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost, either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology. That's that is the next step, there's technology and then there is technology, which we're moving into the next phase. Project Manager : Yeah 'cause that's {gap}. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : And so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability. Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet. Project Manager : Mm. Marketing : So I need a product.

209,"Marketing : This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . {vocalsound} So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those {disfmarker} the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : {vocalsound} The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . {vocalsound} Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ? User Interface : Ah , it's perfect . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : we're going to look at these crite So User Interface : Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market {disfmarker} Marketing : Yes , User Interface : okay . Industrial Designer : {gap} Marketing : we're going to come to {disfmarker} w we'll discuss each one Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : Is that okay ? User Interface : 'Kay . Marketing : One is true , seven is false . Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ . {vocalsound} This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Just write small . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Criteria and rating . Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ? User Interface : Yeah , so you can {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah . That works . Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay . Marketing : Okay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Okay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy {disfmarker} it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two . One is true and seven is false . Project Manager : {vocalsound} I would agree . Industrial Designer : Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh {vocalsound} two {disfmarker} yeah , Marketing : I'll just go this way . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : 'Kay . Industrial Designer : two or three . Marketing : Two . Industrial Designer : No , three . Three . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : I would say two . Marketing : Two . User Interface : {vocalsound} I would say four . Marketing : A four , okay . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? Uh two and three quarters , it that right . User Interface : Almost three . Industrial Designer : Mm yeah . Marketing : Two and three quarters ? User Interface : I think yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Marketing : Okay . Two point seven five , there we go . {vocalsound} Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . I would give that a three . Industrial Designer : I'd give it a one . Marketing : Okay . Not that you're biased {vocalsound} in that it {disfmarker} the designer . Industrial Designer : No , no , not at all . Project Manager : A two . User Interface : Oh sorry , I I got it wrong . The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ? The first . Marketing : The average {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah , I I just {gap} it the other way . Marketing : oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ? User Interface : Uh in {gap} Yep , I just got {disfmarker} Marketing : Okay . User Interface : {gap} Marketing : So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered {disfmarker} Okay , User Interface : two point f Marketing : and we're just waiting for your rating Project Manager : It's just two point five for that one . Marketing : f Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Two point five , okay . Losing one decimal place , that's okay . User Interface : One is a {gap} , seven is false , okay . Marketing : So what are you rating for this one , Paw ? User Interface : Two . Marketing : Two , okay . So that is eight . That brings it down to two , Industrial Designer : Two . Marketing : nice and simple , yeah . Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ? Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . Industrial Designer : Two . Marketing : Two . Project Manager : I would say a two . I would say a two . Marketing : A two , okay . User Interface : Two . Marketing : Two . I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ? User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} We'll just put almost two , Project Manager : One point seven f five . Marketing : because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . Project Manager : Okay , mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Okay . Or we {disfmarker} or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at Industrial Designer : D_ . Marketing : it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . Industrial Designer : One . Yeah . Marketing : Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's {disfmarker} Marketing : Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? Industrial Designer : No , no , the the base colour was um {vocalsound} white or or like or l sort of a light blue , User Interface : White . With {disfmarker} for the plastic ? Uh blue . Industrial Designer : but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any {disfmarker} basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised . Marketing : Right . User Interface : Any {disfmarker} Marketing : So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . User Interface : Right . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , yeah User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} Marketing : And the spongy feel is no problem with that . User Interface : Yeah , because you'll be having a {disfmarker} Because of the rubber case . Industrial Designer : No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that {disfmarker} otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic . Marketing : Okay . In that case it's got to be a one for me . Industrial Designer : Yeah , I'll give it a one as well . Marketing : Yep . Project Manager : One . Marketing : Everybody ? Okay . User Interface : One . Marketing : {vocalsound} That part was nice and easy . User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} Marketing : Okay . Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . Industrial Designer : No . Marketing : We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ Industrial Designer : It's meant to be . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : it's meant to . Um Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : maybe because it's slightl Industrial Designer : {gap} Project Manager : with the size that we've got it's quite small , Industrial Designer : {gap} Project Manager : but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Right . Project Manager : It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um {disfmarker} Marketing : Right . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , Marketing : A five , okay . Industrial Designer : 'cause {disfmarker} Project Manager : Four . Marketing : Four and a four okay . User Interface : Four . Marketing : Twenty one {disfmarker} is that twenty one ? User Interface : {gap} Marketing : So that's four point two five . Industrial Designer : Yep . Marketing : And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , User Interface : Voice r recognition . Marketing : It was the I'm here thing , Industrial Designer : yeah . Marketing : yep . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} yeah , that's feasible . Marketing : That sounds good then . I'd go for a {disfmarker} I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or . Industrial Designer : Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand Project Manager : A standard . Industrial Designer : it would be quite loud . Project Manager : It would be . Marketing : Right . Okay . Industrial Designer : So it would be s p Marketing : You built into the feature . Project Manager : And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . Industrial Designer : yeah . Marketing : Okay . Logical . That's a one for me . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , one . Marketing : One Project Manager : One . User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Marketing : and one , good . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} So , User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} Marketing : how do we feel about this ? Industrial Designer : {gap} {gap} Marketing : We've got our our {disfmarker} we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . {vocalsound} Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? Project Manager : I don't think so . Industrial Designer : W I thin yeah , I think {disfmarker} Marketing : We happy to go ahead ? Project Manager : I think we {disfmarker} yeah . I think we're set . Industrial Designer : yeah . Marketing : Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . Project Manager : Do much apart from having a huge big {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : I know . Okay . Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team . Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up ? Project Manager : Don't think so . Industrial Designer : No . Marketing : Good . Fine then .

Now, the collection of the criteria, as we saw in our previous meeting, was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company. So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting, are we actually meeting those trends and requirements? Now the findings that we came up with, just a recap, are here. The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, it should be easy to use, it should incorporate current fashion trends, and those {disfmarker} the two main ones, they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours. User Interface : Mm-hmm. Marketing : {vocalsound} The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, but there was also, on the sideline, the though of maybe having a beeper function. {vocalsound} Okay, so we can come back to that slide, if you don't have a note of those. I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this, to what we have so far. We're going to use a seven point scale, where one is true and seven is false. We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned, I'll call that slide back up, Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here. User Interface : Mm-hmm. Marketing : Does that seem clear? Any questions there? User Interface : Ah, it's perfect. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : we're going to look at these crite So User Interface : Is it everybody is going to evaluate, or just the Market {disfmarker} Marketing : Yes, User Interface : okay. Industrial Designer : {gap} Marketing : we're going to come to {disfmarker} w we'll discuss each one Project Manager : Mm-hmm. Marketing : and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven. Project Manager : Okay. Marketing : Is that okay? User Interface : 'Kay. Marketing : One is true, seven is false. Right. So I won't write all of that out again. It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, or A_, B_, C_, D_, E_, F_ to confuse it with the number rating. B_, C_, D_, E_, F_. {vocalsound} This is where I realise how tiny I actually am. {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Just write small. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Criteria and rating. Actually, it might be an idea, if we each did give our own individual rating, and we could take an average at the end. How about that? User Interface : Yeah, so you can {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah. That works. Industrial Designer : Yeah, okay. Marketing : Okay. So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques, and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's who. Project Manager : Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : Okay. Criteria A_, the fancy look and feel. How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy {disfmarker} it is a fancy look and feel. One is true, seven is false. My own rating for that would be a two. One is true and seven is false. Project Manager : {vocalsound} I would agree. Industrial Designer : Yeah, I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh {vocalsound} two {disfmarker} yeah, Marketing : I'll just go this way. Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : 'Kay. Industrial Designer : two or three. Marketing : Two. Industrial Designer : No, three. Three. Marketing : Okay. Project Manager : I would say two. Marketing : Two. User Interface : {vocalsound} I would say four. Marketing : A four, okay. User Interface : Mm-hmm. Marketing : Adding those up, we've got a six and a five, eleven divided by four is what? Uh two and three quarters, it that right. User Interface : Almost three. Industrial Designer : Mm yeah. Marketing : Two and three quarters? User Interface : I think yeah. Industrial Designer : Yeah, yeah. Marketing : Okay. Two point seven five, there we go. {vocalsound} Okay, criteria B_, criterion B_, technologically innovative. I would give that a three. Industrial Designer : I'd give it a one. Marketing : Okay. Not that you're biased {vocalsound} in that it {disfmarker} the designer. Industrial Designer : No, no, not at all. Project Manager : A two. User Interface : Oh sorry, I I got it wrong. The first one rating, I'm sorry. Can you just make it two? The first. Marketing : The average {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah, I I just {gap} it the other way. Marketing : oh, for you? You want your rating to be a two? Is that what you're saying? User Interface : Uh in {gap} Yep, I just got {disfmarker} Marketing : Okay. User Interface : {gap} Marketing : So, I'll work out the average for that again at the end. It's a very slightly altered {disfmarker} Okay, User Interface : two point f Marketing : and we're just waiting for your rating Project Manager : It's just two point five for that one. Marketing : f Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : Two point five, okay. Losing one decimal place, that's okay. User Interface : One is a {gap}, seven is false, okay. Marketing : So what are you rating for this one, Paw? User Interface : Two. Marketing : Two, okay. So that is eight. That brings it down to two, Industrial Designer : Two. Marketing : nice and simple, yeah. Okay, ease of use. Easy to use? Based on what you've said there, I would say a one, true. Industrial Designer : Two. Marketing : Two. Project Manager : I would say a two. I would say a two. Marketing : A two, okay. User Interface : Two. Marketing : Two. I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy, shouldn't I? User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} We'll just put almost two, Project Manager : One point seven f five. Marketing : because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places. Project Manager : Okay, mm-hmm. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : Okay. Or we {disfmarker} or if we want to really bring it down, we can do later. Um mm now we're looking at Industrial Designer : D_. Marketing : it incorporates current fashion trends, now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours. Industrial Designer : One. Yeah. Marketing : Right. So I'm just thinking, before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here. Industrial Designer : Yeah, that's {disfmarker} Marketing : Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use? Industrial Designer : No, no, the the base colour was um {vocalsound} white or or like or l sort of a light blue, User Interface : White. With {disfmarker} for the plastic? Uh blue. Industrial Designer : but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any {disfmarker} basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised. Marketing : Right. User Interface : Any {disfmarker} Marketing : So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do. User Interface : Right. Industrial Designer : Yeah, yeah, yeah User Interface : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : Mm-hmm. Marketing : Okay. Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} Marketing : And the spongy feel is no problem with that. User Interface : Yeah, because you'll be having a {disfmarker} Because of the rubber case. Industrial Designer : No, no, 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it, that {disfmarker} otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic. Marketing : Okay. In that case it's got to be a one for me. Industrial Designer : Yeah, I'll give it a one as well. Marketing : Yep. Project Manager : One. Marketing : Everybody? Okay. User Interface : One. Marketing : {vocalsound} That part was nice and easy. User Interface : Mm. Industrial Designer : Yeah. {vocalsound} Marketing : Okay. Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury. Industrial Designer : Mm. Marketing : I don't think we've really touched on that a lot. Industrial Designer : No. Marketing : We've we've discussed it, we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that. We've talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote control, if you're someone who's zapping, who's sitting like that, and we found so many people did, how do you minimise that on such a small device? Industrial Designer : Yeah. Project Manager : Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half, the material, minimises R_S_I_ Industrial Designer : It's meant to be. Marketing : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : it's meant to. Um Marketing : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : maybe because it's slightl Industrial Designer : {gap} Project Manager : with the size that we've got it's quite small, Industrial Designer : {gap} Project Manager : but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much. Marketing : Mm. Project Manager : So maybe because there's more space, it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between. Marketing : Mm-hmm. Right. Project Manager : It's quite obvious just big buttons. Um {disfmarker} Marketing : Right. I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Yeah, I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five, actually, Marketing : A five, okay. Industrial Designer : 'cause {disfmarker} Project Manager : Four. Marketing : Four and a four okay. User Interface : Four. Marketing : Twenty one {disfmarker} is that twenty one? User Interface : {gap} Marketing : So that's four point two five. Industrial Designer : Yep. Marketing : And finally, last but not least, easy to locate. Now we talked about voice recognition, we talked about a beeper, have we really {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : have the designers come to any dec real decision on that? Industrial Designer : Yeah, it was it was uh a voice voice recognition, User Interface : Voice r recognition. Marketing : It was the I'm here thing, Industrial Designer : yeah. Marketing : yep. And are we happy with the costs on that? That is going to be feasible, cost-wise. Industrial Designer : Yeah, yeah, that {disfmarker} yeah, that's feasible. Marketing : That sounds good then. I'd go for a {disfmarker} I ca we can adjust the volume on that, just as we could volume on T_V_. So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms, or. Industrial Designer : Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand Project Manager : A standard. Industrial Designer : it would be quite loud. Project Manager : It would be. Marketing : Right. Okay. Industrial Designer : So it would be s p Marketing : You built into the feature. Project Manager : And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in, then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room, you'd go into another room. Industrial Designer : yeah. Marketing : Okay. Logical. That's a one for me. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah, one. Marketing : One Project Manager : One. User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Marketing : and one, good. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I do realise that we might be being fairly biased, 'cause it is our product, Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} So, User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} Marketing : how do we feel about this? Industrial Designer : {gap} {gap} Marketing : We've got our our {disfmarker} we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there. That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate. The lowest rating we've got, which is really n it's not terribly low, i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury. {vocalsound} Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it, or do we have to make further modifications? Project Manager : I don't think so. Industrial Designer : W I thin yeah, I think {disfmarker} Marketing : We happy to go ahead? Project Manager : I think we {disfmarker} yeah. I think we're set. Industrial Designer : yeah. Marketing : Yeah. I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that. Project Manager : Do much apart from having a huge big {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Mm. Marketing : I know. Okay. Well, I hope that's uh clear to the team. Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up? Project Manager : Don't think so. Industrial Designer : No. Marketing : Good. Fine then. I'll just leave it there.

But, it's like like a statue or something {gap} {disfmarker} Marketing : Or uh yeah, yeah. Yeah. User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : More like a joystick then. Marketing : Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean, yep. User Interface : It's like you have uh four phones. Something like that. Project Manager : Yeah yeah, but {disfmarker} yeah, but you also can put it somewhere near the window in {disfmarker} Marketing : If you do that, but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros. Project Manager : That it's it's fashionable. User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {gap} I {gap} I don't {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} I in in the base we could like make uh a button, and if you push it, the remote control itself s makes noise. Project Manager : Oh, yeah. Marketing : That's probably stupid, but uh as I found here uh, fifty percent, was it fifty? Industrial Designer : But that's that's fun for the first time, and then the second {disfmarker} Marketing : Uh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control. Project Manager : Yeah, but but when you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} when it gets lost, how can you press the button to make it {disfmarker} Marketing : No uh, of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Oh, okay. User Interface : On the television. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Uh, that's kind of nice. User Interface : Oh, like this. Marketing : If an {disfmarker} a button in in that uh {disfmarker} User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : And then also you don't even need batteries, because you can make it uh chargeable. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Or you can {disfmarker} User Interface : A char {vocalsound} chargeable. Yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah, you can ma make rechargeable one, yeah. Why not. Industrial Designer : Yeah. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah, that w yeah, but {disfmarker} yeah, the pro No, well I think that it might be t p Well, nee but we don't {disfmarker} Yeah. User Interface : Why not. Project Manager : Maybe you, but {vocalsound} we don't know much about production cost, but when you {disfmarker} you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control, then the then the money {disfmarker} there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know, {gap} rechargeable units. Industrial Designer : With recharger. User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : It should only cost twelve and a half Euros, of course. Aye? Project Manager : Yeah, but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So, it's not gonna be that expen User Interface : Production. {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah, okay. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Uh I I think it's a great idea. User Interface : It should be possible. I think it's a good idea. Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : S some kind of be I've never seen that before, and you make it uh um be uh, you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays. User Interface : To make a base or something? Marketing : Yes. Yes, definitely. Yeah. Industrial Designer : Yes, but is that handy? Project Manager : Well, I {disfmarker} well it's really ch you can recharge it, so you ha never have the battery problem. That's one {gap}. User Interface : It's it's it's it's Project Manager : And uh you can always find your remote control up {disfmarker} User Interface : it's not the purpose to be handy, it's Industrial Designer : But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years, three years, with with t two batteries. Project Manager : Uh, okay. Well, maybe yeah, you could {disfmarker} when that's {disfmarker} when it's too costly, you could probably skip the recharger, Industrial Designer : And then you {disfmarker} Project Manager : but you will {disfmarker} you do need uh also an {disfmarker} uh, also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well, you know. Does it makes it kinda {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yes. Or {disfmarker} Marketing : Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts, of course. User Interface : Mm. Yeah, but that's not {disfmarker} it's ugly, I think. Project Manager : Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Marketing : I don't know. Project Manager : Yeah, but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it. User Interface : No. Marketing : On the other hand, if you don't do it, we can also make a nice bay. I mean, it looks trendy and still {vocalsound} still put a bleep function in it, Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah.

228,"Project Manager : {vocalsound} Uh welcome back after lunch , I hope uh you had a good lunch together . For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . Okay and the agenda will be the opening and uh {disfmarker} that's uh {disfmarker} the product manager or secretary that's me and uh the presentations from the Christine and uh Agnes and from Mister Ed . And finally in this meeting we have to decide Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design So we have forty minutes , I think it's uh little bit uh low , but I I hope we can finish it up {vocalsound} so I'll handle to the the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept . Industrial Designer : Okay . So uh , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation . Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : I'm number two . Project Manager : You're number two . 'Kay Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Components design , there we go . Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : So uh can we put it in slide show mode ? Yeah . Project Manager : The next one . Industrial Designer : Right here , is that little {disfmarker} that one , yes please . Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Thank you . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : I'll take the mouse . {vocalsound} So uh Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : we were looking he specifically at the components uh {disfmarker} the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : you have to have microphone {disfmarker} well no you don't actually I haven't {disfmarker} have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : it has to it has to hear the speaker User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . Um so the other w thing that we {disfmarker} So . Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also um {disfmarker} we wanted to evaluate some new materials Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might {vocalsound} come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um {disfmarker} our research . Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . Marketing : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh {disfmarker} we can really seriously explore , User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : and th um there might be some {vocalsound} problems with the m uh how it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh goes with the board . {vocalsound} Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle {disfmarker} it gets brittle after a while , User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh , User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how {vocalsound} Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood . User Interface : {vocalsound} At least it's environmentally friendly . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} So , {vocalsound} this is our finding . Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we're {disfmarker} we're {vocalsound} currently uh proposing , Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {disfmarker} uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . And um then there was the regular which {vocalsound} I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , {vocalsound} and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : which w 'member the beam was {disfmarker} that was an important component of finding the right chip . Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a {disfmarker} this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . So this is the findings of our research Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . Do you have any problems with that ? Project Manager : {vocalsound} Can you go back uh one slide ? Industrial Designer : I'm not sure , how do I {disfmarker} Oh , I know , let's see . User Interface : Thank you . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Let's go back up here . Project Manager : Yes , uh {gap} question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? What's the meaning of that ? Industrial Designer : I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um {vocalsound} and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board . User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting . Project Manager : Yeah , is it means it's on the {disfmarker} yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting . Project Manager : Okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good . Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Sounds good . User Interface : Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? Industrial Designer : Because um it gets brittle , cracks {disfmarker} User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Um We want {disfmarker} we expect these um {vocalsound} uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . So . {vocalsound} Good ex {vocalsound} {gap} Good expression . {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Whic Marketing : Wow , User Interface : {vocalsound} Which {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} good expression . Well after us . {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : I don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while . {vocalsound} User Interface : Although I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you , I mean it chips , it if you drop it , Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : uh it's {disfmarker} I'm not su {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Project Manager : So {gap} so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes . User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {gap} you're what ? Marketing : Actually , I'm ready to sell it . User Interface : I think {vocalsound} if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , Marketing : I'm ready to sell it . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} You think ? {vocalsound} And you could {disfmarker} you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . User Interface : but you can't just use {disfmarker} Marketing : No y {vocalsound} no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , User Interface : Yeah , exactly , yeah . Marketing : but there are some very pretty woods out there {vocalsound} . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well I'm glad you {disfmarker} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : That's actually very innovative idea . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay , good . User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : The stain . Marketing : {vocalsound} I mean it's {disfmarker} each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market . Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ? Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Um , in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} In turns of wow . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : She works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this {vocalsound} . User Interface : Y yeah . Marketing : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Luckily Ed was not . {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Wood ? {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} I think we can get the quality materials then {vocalsound} it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation . Marketing : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} User Interface : One thing we'd have to check though is what the users {disfmarker} whether {disfmarker} how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Yeah , you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your {disfmarker} User Interface : {disfmarker} Yeah , for example . {vocalsound} So , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it {vocalsound} {gap} for teething . User Interface : but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , Industrial Designer : Yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . Marketing : so {vocalsound} , and chew 'em up . And chew 'em up . Project Manager : Okay then , uh , let's move to Agnes . Project Manager : so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get {disfmarker} to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . So , but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking . And your design {vocalsound} whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so User Interface : Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} I think it depends , I mean I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display {vocalsound} right in front of you . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Hmm . User Interface : So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . Industrial Designer : Hmm . User Interface : I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Hmm . User Interface : very specifically what it would be used for , Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : but that's just sort of speculation , I mean . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} What do you think Ed ? Do you {disfmarker} he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ? Marketing : {vocalsound} No . No Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? Marketing : {gap} no p spec {vocalsound} It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . Industrial Designer : Okay . {vocalsound} Sorry about that . Marketing : Um , no that's no problem . I'm here for the {vocalsound} pushing it after it's made . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : I will market it . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Once we get a price on it then we can market it . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the {vocalsound} the advanced chip on print is what um what we've {vocalsound} we've deci we've determined Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . Project Manager : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} User Interface : Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : A customisable and {disfmarker} Marketing : Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . {vocalsound} User Interface : What about the buttons , would {disfmarker} Would the buttons be wood too , or {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Uh I don't think so , no , Project Manager : I don't think so . Industrial Designer : I think they could be rubber like they are now , Project Manager : Yes . Yes .

User Interface : Thank you. Yeah. Industrial Designer : Let's go back up here. Project Manager : Yes, uh {gap} question, uh, what's mean exactly, advanced chip on print? What's the meaning of that? Industrial Designer : I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um {vocalsound} and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board. User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Mm-hmm. Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting. Project Manager : Yeah, is it means it's on the {disfmarker} yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I don't know, but I'll find out more at our next meeting. Project Manager : Okay, tha that would be great, so if you find out from the technology background, okay, so that would be good. Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Sounds good. User Interface : Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material? Industrial Designer : Because um it gets brittle, cracks {disfmarker} User Interface : Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer : Um We want {disfmarker} we expect these um {vocalsound} uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years. So. {vocalsound} Good ex {vocalsound} {gap} Good expression. {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Whic Marketing : Wow, User Interface : {vocalsound} Which {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} good expression. Well after us. {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : I don't know, speak for yourself, I'm planning to be around for a while. {vocalsound} User Interface : Although I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems, wouldn't you, I mean it chips, it if you drop it, Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : uh it's {disfmarker} I'm not su {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Project Manager : So {gap} so you're not convinced about the the wood, yes. User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {gap} you're what? Marketing : Actually, I'm ready to sell it. User Interface : I think {vocalsound} if you re if you use really good quality wood, then it might work, Marketing : I'm ready to sell it. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} You think? {vocalsound} And you could {disfmarker} you could sell oils with it, to take care of it. User Interface : but you can't just use {disfmarker} Marketing : No y {vocalsound} no no no, the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard, extremely hard wood, User Interface : Yeah, exactly, yeah. Marketing : but there are some very pretty woods out there {vocalsound}. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well I'm glad you {disfmarker} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : That's actually very innovative idea. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay, good. User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face. {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Well, it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood, your type of wood. Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm. User Interface : The stain. Marketing : {vocalsound} I mean it's {disfmarker} each person is gonna have their own personalised, individualised speech recognition remote control in wood, that's not on the market. Industrial Designer : Mm. User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah, so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh, what about yo you? Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Um, in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yes, in t yes, in term in terms of comments first {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} In turns of wow. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : She works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this {vocalsound}. User Interface : Y yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Luckily Ed was not. {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Wood? {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} I think we can get the quality materials then {vocalsound} it shouldn't influence the design principles too much, which you'll see with my presentation. Marketing : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} User Interface : One thing we'd have to check though is what the users {disfmarker} whether {disfmarker} how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm. Yeah, you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your {disfmarker} User Interface : {disfmarker} Yeah, for example. {vocalsound} So, have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that, Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it, they can use it {vocalsound} {gap} for teething. User Interface : but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic, Industrial Designer : Yeah, they do it with other materials as well, yeah. Marketing : so {vocalsound}, and chew 'em up. And chew 'em up. Project Manager : Okay then, uh, let's move to Agnes. Project Manager : so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric, okay, for the different uh electronics items, then we can have a business tie-up and to get {disfmarker} to cut the cost, okay, to sell more. So, but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept, okay, if is acceptable for both of you, what uh Ed was talking. And your design {vocalsound} whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple, so User Interface : Mm-hmm. {vocalsound} I think it depends, I mean I think it's a good idea, but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display {vocalsound} right in front of you. Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Hmm. User Interface : So, if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go. Industrial Designer : Hmm. User Interface : I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Hmm. User Interface : very specifically what it would be used for, Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm. User Interface : 'cause if it's only used for one little thing, then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever, may not be the most cost-efficient way to go, Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : but that's just sort of speculation, I mean. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} What do you think Ed? Do you {disfmarker} he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed, um, do you know how much it costs, um, to to add a little display like this uh? Marketing : {vocalsound} No. No Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Do you wanna take an action item to go find out? Marketing : {gap} no p spec {vocalsound} It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it. Industrial Designer : Okay. {vocalsound} Sorry about that. Marketing : Um, no that's no problem. I'm here for the {vocalsound} pushing it after it's made. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yes. Marketing : I will market it. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Once we get a price on it then we can market it. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the {vocalsound} the advanced chip on print is what um what we've {vocalsound} we've deci we've determined Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation, and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"
234,"PhD A : Yeah . Grad B : And so what uh uh a s you s let 's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance won't really give us is what the person actually wants . Does he wanna go there to see it ? Does he wanna go there now ? Later ? How does the person wanna go there ? Is that person more likely to want to walk there ? Walk a scenic route ? and so forth . There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things . And we are constructing {disfmarker} and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role . Information related to the user and information related to the situation . And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that what we can get from the utterance . That 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it . And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention {pause} was . And then enrich or augment the M - three - L structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance . So if it can make a good suggestion , "" Hey ! "" you know , "" that person doesn't wanna enter . That person just wants to take a picture , "" cuz he just bought film , or "" that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before "" . Or "" that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something and that you usually do inside of buildings "" and so forth . These ah these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the M - three - L structure in an {disfmarker} sort of subfield that we have reserved . And if the action planner does something with it , great . If not you know , then that 's also something um that we can't really {disfmarker} at least we {comment} want to offer the extra information . We don't really {disfmarker} um we 're not too worried . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Grad D : Hmm . Grad B : I mean {disfmarker} t s Ultimately if you have {disfmarker} if you can offer that information , somebody 's gonna s do something with it sooner or later . That 's sort of part of our belief . Grad E : What was he saying ? Grad B : Um , for example , right now I know the GIS from email is not able to calculate these viewpoints . So that 's a functionality that doesn't exist yet to do that dynamically , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Grad B : but if we can offer it that distinction , maybe somebody will go ahead and implement it . Surely nobody 's gonna go ahead and implement it if it 's never gonna be used , so . What have I forgotten about ? Oh yeah , how we do it , Professor F : Well th uh Grad B : yeah that 's the Professor F : No no . It 's a good time to pause . I s I see {pause} questions on peoples ' faces , so why don't {disfmarker} PhD A : Oh Professor F : let 's {disfmarker} let 's {disfmarker} Let 's hear {disfmarker} PhD A : Well the obvious one would be if {disfmarker} if you envision this as a module within SmartKom , where exactly would that Sit ? That 's the d Grad B : um {disfmarker} so far I 've thought of it as sort of adding it onto the modeler knowledge module . PhD A : OK , yeah . Grad B : So this is one that already adds additional information to the Grad D : Hmm . PhD A : Makes perfect sense . Yes . Grad D : Hmm , ah . Grad B : but it could sit anywhere in the attention - recognition I mean basically this is what attention - recognition literally sort of can {disfmarker} PhD A : Well it 's supposed to do . Yeah Grad D : Mmm . Professor F : That 's what it should do . PhD A : Yeah . Professor F : Right , PhD A : Yeah . Professor F : yeah . Grad D : Huh . Grad B : Yeah . PhD A : Well f from my understanding of what the people at Phillips were originally trying to do doesn't seem to quite fit into SmartKom currently so what they 're really doing right now is only selecting among the alternatives , the hypotheses that they 're given enriched by the domain knowledge and the um discourse modeler and so on . Grad B : Yeah . PhD A : So if {disfmarker} if this is additional information that could be merged in by them . Grad B : Yeah . PhD A : And then it would be available to action planning and {disfmarker} and others . Grad B : Yeah . the {disfmarker} Professor F : let 's {disfmarker} let 's That w OK that was one question . Is there other {disfmarker} other things that cuz {pause} we wanna not Pa - pass over any {pause} you know , questions or concerns that you have . PhD A : Well there 're {disfmarker} there 're two levels of {disfmarker} of giving an answer and I guess on both levels I don't have any um further questions . Grad D : Mmm . Mmm . PhD A : uh the {disfmarker} the two levels will be as far as I 'm concerned as {pause} uh standing here for the generation module Grad D : Mmm . PhD A : and the other is {disfmarker} is my understanding of what SmartKom uh is supposed to be Professor F : Right . PhD A : and I {disfmarker} I think that fits in perfectly Professor F : So {disfmarker} well , let me {disfmarker} Let me s {pause} expand on that a little bit from the point of view of the generation . Grad D : Hmm . PhD A : Yeah . Professor F : So the idea is that we 've actually got this all laid out an and we could show it to you ig um Robert didn't bring it today but there 's a {disfmarker} a belief - net which is {disfmarker} There 's a first cut at a belief - net that {disfmarker} that doesn't {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} isn't fully uh instantiated , and in particular some of the {disfmarker} the combination rules and ways of getting the {disfmarker} the conditional probabilities aren't there . But we believe that we have laid out the fundamental decisions in this little space PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor F : and the things that influence them . So one of the decisions is what we call this AVE thing . Do you want to um access , view or enter a thing . Grad D : Hmm . Professor F : So that 's a a discrete decision . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor F : There are only three possibilities and the uh {disfmarker} what one would like is for this uh , knowledge modeling module to add which of those it is and give it to the planner . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor F : But , uh th the current design suggests that if it seems to be an important decision and if the belief - net is equivocal so that it doesn't say that one of these is much more probable than the other , then an option is to go back and ask for the information you want . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor F : Alright ? Now there are two ways one can go {disfmarker} a imagine doing that . For the debugging we 'll probably just have a {disfmarker} a drop - down menu and the {disfmarker} while you 're debugging you will just {disfmarker} OK . But for a full system , then one might very well formulate a query , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor F : give it to the dialogue planner and say this , you know ar are you know you {disfmarker} are you planning to enter ? Or whatever it {disfmarker} whatever that might be . So that 's {disfmarker} under that model then , There would be a {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} um a loop in which this thing would formulate a query , PhD A : Yes . Professor F : presumably give it to you . That would get expressed and then hopefully you know , you 'd get an answer {pause} back . PhD A : Yep . Professor F : And that would of course {disfmarker} the answer would have to be parsed . Grad D : Mmm . Yep . Professor F : right and {disfmarker} PhD A : Yes . Professor F : OK so , {pause} th {pause} that uh , We probably won't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that . PhD A : Yep . Professor F : But While we 're on the subject I just wanted to give you a sort of head 's up that it could be that some months from now we said "" OK we 're now ready to try to close that loop "" in terms of querying about some of these decisions . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

Grad B : And so what uh uh a s you s let's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance won't really give us is what the person actually wants. Does he wanna go there to see it?

244,"PhD E : Yeah . Professor C : And then , given that as a base , you can see if that gets improved , you know , or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} {pause} or worsened {pause} by the {disfmarker} looking at regular energy , looking at log energy , we were just proposing that maybe it 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's harder to {pause} see with the log energy , um and uh also these different normalizations , does a particular choice of normalization make it better ? PhD E : Yeah . Professor C : But I had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on , that you look at scatter plots because that 's looking at a distribution in two dimensions . Let 's start off just in one , uh , with this feature . PhD E : Yeah . Yeah . Professor C : I think that 's probably the most basic thing , before anything very complicated . PhD E : Yeah . Professor C : Um And then we w I think we 're agreed that pitch - related things are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are going to be a {disfmarker} a really likely candidate to help . PhD D : Yeah . PhD E : Yeah . I agree , yeah . Uh - huh . Professor C : Um {pause} But {pause} since {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh your intuition from looking at some of the data , is that when you looked at the regular energy , that it did in fact usually go up , {vocalsound} when two people were talking , {vocalsound} that 's {disfmarker} eh you know , you should be able to come up with a measure which will {pause} match your intuition . PhD E : OK . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Professor C : And she 's right , that a {disfmarker} that having a {disfmarker} having {disfmarker} {comment} having this table , with a whole bunch of things , {pause} with the standard deviation , the variance and so forth , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's harder to interpret than just looking at the {disfmarker} the same kind of picture you have here . PhD E : But {disfmarker} Uh - huh . Yeah . But {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it 's curious but uh I f I found it in the {disfmarker} in the mixed file , in one channel {vocalsound} that eh in several {disfmarker} oh e eh several times eh you have an speaker talking alone with a high level of energy Professor C : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD E : eh in the middle eh a zone of overlapping with mmm less energy Professor C : Mm - hmm . PhD E : and eh come with another speaker with high energy Professor C : Mm - hmm . PhD E : and the overlapping zone has eh less energy . Professor C : Yeah . So there 'll be some cases for which {disfmarker} PhD E : Because there reach very many Professor C : But , the qu So {disfmarker} So they 'll be {disfmarker} PhD D : Right . Professor C : This is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I w want to point {pause} to visual things , But I mean they {disfmarker} there 'll be time {disfmarker} There 'll be overlap between the distributions , but the question is , "" If it 's a reasonable feature at all , there 's some separation . "" PhD E : Yeah . Yeah . PhD D : Especially locally . Professor C : Mm - hmm . PhD D : So . Locally . PhD E : just locally , yeah . Grad A : And {disfmarker} I was just going to say that {disfmarker} that {pause} right now we 're just exploring . PhD D : And the other thing is I Sorry . I {disfmarker} Grad A : What you would imagine eventually , is that you 'll feed all of these features into some {pause} discriminative system . PhD E : Yeah . Professor C : Yeah . Grad A : And so even if {disfmarker} if one of the features does a good job at one type of overlap , another feature might do a good job at another type of overlap . PhD E : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Professor C : Right . I mean the {disfmarker} the reason I had suggested the scatter f p features is I used to do this a lot , when we had thirteen or fifteen or twenty features {pause} to look at . PhD E : Yeah , this is the {disfmarker} Professor C : um Because something is a good feature uh by itself , you don't really know how it 'll behave in combination and so it 's nice to have as many {disfmarker} as many together at the same time as possible in uh in some reasonable visual form . There 's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny {disfmarker} funny way . But it 's true that you shouldn't do any of that unless you know that the individual ones , at least , have {disfmarker} have some uh {disfmarker} some hope PhD E : Yeah . PhD D : Well , especially for normalizing . Professor C : Mm - hmm . PhD D : I mean , it 's really important to {pause} pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature . Professor C : Mm - hmm . PhD D : And it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same . e Actually , I was wondering , {vocalsound} right now you 're taking a {disfmarker} all of the {pause} speech , from the whole meeting , and you 're trying to find points of overlap , but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker , Professor C : Right . PhD D : right ? So I mean another way would just be to take the speech from just , say , Morgan , And just Jane and then just their overlaps , PhD E : Yeah . PhD D : like {disfmarker} but by hand , by cheating , and looking at you know , if you can detect something that way , because if we can't do it that way , there 's no good way that we 're going to be able to do it . Grad A : No prayer . PhD D : That {disfmarker} You know , there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just {pause} individuals and then that combination alone . PhD E : Yeah . PhD D : Plus , I think it has more elegant {disfmarker} e Professor C : Mm - hmm . PhD D : The m the right model will be {pause} easier to see that way . So if {disfmarker} I don't know , if you go through and you find Adam , cuz he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e enough speech PhD E : Yeah .

Professor C : And then, given that as a base, you can see if that gets improved, you know, or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} {pause} or worsened {pause} by the {disfmarker} looking at regular energy, looking at log energy, we were just proposing that maybe it's {disfmarker} you know, it's harder to {pause} see with the log energy, um and uh also these different normalizations, does a particular choice of normalization make it better? PhD E : Yeah. Professor C : But I had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on, that you look at scatter plots because that's looking at a distribution in two dimensions. Let's start off just in one, uh, with this feature. PhD E : Yeah. Yeah. Professor C : I think that's probably the most basic thing, before anything very complicated. PhD E : Yeah. Professor C : Um And then we w I think we're agreed that pitch - related things are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are going to be a {disfmarker} a really likely candidate to help. PhD D : Yeah. PhD E : Yeah. I agree, yeah. Uh - huh. Professor C : Um {pause} But {pause} since {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh your intuition from looking at some of the data, is that when you looked at the regular energy, that it did in fact usually go up, {vocalsound} when two people were talking, {vocalsound} that's {disfmarker} eh you know, you should be able to come up with a measure which will {pause} match your intuition. PhD E : OK. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Professor C : And she's right, that a {disfmarker} that having a {disfmarker} having {disfmarker} {comment} having this table, with a whole bunch of things, {pause} with the standard deviation, the variance and so forth, it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it's harder to interpret than just looking at the {disfmarker} the same kind of picture you have here. PhD E : But {disfmarker} Uh - huh. Yeah. But {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it's curious but uh I f I found it in the {disfmarker} in the mixed file, in one channel {vocalsound} that eh in several {disfmarker} oh e eh several times eh you have an speaker talking alone with a high level of energy Professor C : Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. PhD E : eh in the middle eh a zone of overlapping with mmm less energy Professor C : Mm - hmm. PhD E : and eh come with another speaker with high energy Professor C : Mm - hmm. PhD E : and the overlapping zone has eh less energy. Professor C : Yeah. So there 'll be some cases for which {disfmarker} PhD E : Because there reach very many Professor C : But, the qu So {disfmarker} So they 'll be {disfmarker} PhD D : Right. Professor C : This is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I w want to point {pause} to visual things, But I mean they {disfmarker} there 'll be time {disfmarker} There 'll be overlap between the distributions, but the question is, "" If it's a reasonable feature at all, there's some separation. "" PhD E : Yeah. Yeah. PhD D : Especially locally. Professor C : Mm - hmm. PhD D : So. Locally. PhD E : just locally, yeah. Grad A : And {disfmarker} I was just going to say that {disfmarker} that {pause} right now we're just exploring. PhD D : And the other thing is I Sorry. I {disfmarker} Grad A : What you would imagine eventually, is that you 'll feed all of these features into some {pause} discriminative system. PhD E : Yeah. Professor C : Yeah. Grad A : And so even if {disfmarker} if one of the features does a good job at one type of overlap, another feature might do a good job at another type of overlap. PhD E : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Professor C : Right. I mean the {disfmarker} the reason I had suggested the scatter f p features is I used to do this a lot, when we had thirteen or fifteen or twenty features {pause} to look at. PhD E : Yeah, this is the {disfmarker} Professor C : um Because something is a good feature uh by itself, you don't really know how it 'll behave in combination and so it's nice to have as many {disfmarker} as many together at the same time as possible in uh in some reasonable visual form. There's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny {disfmarker} funny way. But it's true that you shouldn't do any of that unless you know that the individual ones, at least, have {disfmarker} have some uh {disfmarker} some hope PhD E : Yeah. PhD D : Well, especially for normalizing. Professor C : Mm - hmm. PhD D : I mean, it's really important to {pause} pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature. Professor C : Mm - hmm. PhD D : And it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same. e Actually, I was wondering, {vocalsound} right now you're taking a {disfmarker} all of the {pause} speech, from the whole meeting, and you're trying to find points of overlap, but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker, Professor C : Right. PhD D : right? So I mean another way would just be to take the speech from just, say, Morgan, And just Jane and then just their overlaps, PhD E : Yeah. PhD D : like {disfmarker} but by hand, by cheating, and looking at you know, if you can detect something that way, because if we can't do it that way, there's no good way that we're going to be able to do it. Grad A : No prayer. PhD D : That {disfmarker} You know, there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just {pause} individuals and then that combination alone. PhD E : Yeah. PhD D : Plus, I think it has more elegant {disfmarker} e Professor C : Mm - hmm. PhD D : The m the right model will be {pause} easier to see that way. So if {disfmarker} I don't know, if you go through and you find Adam, cuz he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e enough speech PhD E : Yeah. PhD D : and just sort of look at those three cases of Adam and the other person and the overlaps, PhD E : Yeah. PhD D : maybe {disfmarker} and just look at the distributions, maybe there is a clear pattern PhD E : Yeah.

269,"Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you. Just two more questions. One is around emotional and mental health difficulties being experienced by children and young people at the moment. Now, there was a very welcome announcement of £1.25 million pounds for school counselling. How is that, in practical terms, being applied if those children are not actually in school? Kirsty Williams AM : You're right, Dawn: we have to consider how we can support children not only in their learning during this time, but also to recognise the very real impact that the pandemic will have on all of our mental health and well-being—recognising, of course, it is absolutely natural for all of us, including children and young people, to have fears and anxieties at this time. That's a natural reaction to the situation that we find ourselves in. But, of course, there are issues around those children that would have currently been receiving school counselling, and also being able to be in a position to respond to a potential growth in the number of children that are receiving support. So, the additional money will be made available to local authorities to be able to increase and ramp up services to support children and families. In the immediacy, of course, that will have to be done in different ways than perhaps we've traditionally delivered services in the past, because of social distancing and lockdown rules, but we want to get some of these systems in place now, rather than waiting for everything to go back to normal. We need to be able to plan to offer services in the here and now, but also be able to plan for what potentially could be an increase in the demand of those services. So, we've been in close touch with local authorities, asking them what they believe that they will need and how they can use additional financial resources, and we've been very pleased to be able to secure that for them. Dawn Bowden AM : So, that would include things like telephone and video support as well, I guess, then. Kirsty Williams AM : Yes, absolutely. So, that would include remote counselling as in a fashion that we're doing now, but also, as and when some of the restrictions are perhaps removed, looking at an enhanced family therapy, or a therapy approach. So, when we talk about counselling, I think it's important to recognise that there will be some flexibility around this money and it does not necessarily mean that local authorities have to use it on a one-to-one basis. That might not be appropriate for some children, especially our younger children and their families, and they can use that money to provide counselling or therapy—in the widest possible terms—that is the best method to support individual children and their families. But, clearly, we're having to do that in the confines of lockdown and social distancing at the moment.

Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair, next Friday, the Quebec minister of finance, EricGirard, will give an economic update. If EricGirard can give one for Quebec, why can't BillMorneau give one for Canada? Hon. Mona Fortier : Mr.Chair, once again, we have been open and transparent from the outset. We have devoted our energy to support Canadians, workers and businesses. We will continue to do so. Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair, I cannot judge the quality of the work done by the provinces, but what I do know is that Quebec, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland have also made efforts to support their residents economically. Those provinces are able to table economic updates. Yesterday, Saskatchewan even tabled a budget. Why is Bill Morneau unable to table an economic update for all Canadians? Hon. Mona Fortier : Let me repeat for my hon. colleague that we are going through extraordinarily uncertain times. We have continued to be open and transparent. We have reported biweekly to Parliament on the total cost and status of the measures in our economic response plan. Once again, as soon as clear economic projections can be provided, we will provide an update Questions: |eot_id|>assistantassistant

Project Manager : So everybody's okay with the changing covers ? I think that's a good uh good option . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yes . Project Manager : Changing case covers .

329,"Marketing : So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : because they are supposed to be useful . {vocalsound} Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Marketing : and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Agree . Marketing : Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please , where are you ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . Marketing : {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap} . Project Manager : Why not ? {vocalsound} Marketing : But why not ? Yeah . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great . Marketing : {vocalsound} So I think they are bad . {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Marketing : Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my Industrial Designer : Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect . Marketing : Oh , okay , User Interface : No , I don't think so . Marketing : I think it's a technical thing Industrial Designer : Yeah , Marketing : which our {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : Okay . Industrial Designer : and those waves have high {disfmarker} Marketing : So , it seems that {vocalsound} it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound} User Interface : But twenty six percent , do you know {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Or something we don't know . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Uh . User Interface : Twenty five . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Uh . Marketing : but we have to take this into account . User Interface : Every fourth , you know . {vocalsound} Every four {disfmarker} some of us knows . Industrial Designer : Yeah it's {disfmarker} People really {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay . Marketing : So anyway User Interface : One of us {disfmarker} Marketing : that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So we've listed a couple of uh User Interface : Functions . Marketing : s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you {vocalsound} use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used {disfmarker} very often used and indeed uh very relevant . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Ah {vocalsound} now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : it's repetitivity stress injury . {vocalsound} We have to be careful with that word but {vocalsound} uh anyway Industrial Designer : Uh . Marketing : I continue my presentation so {disfmarker} yeah , User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so . Project Manager : I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet . Marketing : I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were {disfmarker} had I think ten I think . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant . Project Manager : Mm-hmm User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think {disfmarker} net next slide . {vocalsound} One of the thing {disfmarker} the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility {disfmarker} the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the relevance goes down . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . Marketing : {vocalsound} So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? Industrial Designer : 'Cause {disfmarker} Marketing : I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they {disfmarker} this should be so now Project Manager : Mm-mm . Okay . Marketing : this is of course , depends on that . And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ? Project Manager : Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review . User Interface : I got one question , Marketing : I can go back . Industrial Designer : Thank you . Marketing : Yeah one question , User Interface : uh you are a Market Expert Marketing : yeah ? User Interface : so Marketing : I am . {vocalsound} User Interface : should we aim at the young people or not ? Marketing : I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are {disfmarker} they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than {disfmarker} more than {disfmarker} User Interface : Okay , then teletext is used less . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Then teletext is useless for them I think , User Interface : Okay . Marketing : yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Project Manager : That's good point . Marketing : But {disfmarker} yeah . Nope . Industrial Designer : Mm , yep . User Interface : Mm . Okay . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : 'Kay ?

Marketing : Not very relevant, so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant. Project Manager : Mm-hmm User Interface : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful. For instance I think {disfmarker} net next slide. {vocalsound} One of the thing {disfmarker} the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility {disfmarker} the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control, so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want. So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age. Young people, probably because it's a buzz word, find it very relevant. And uh as the age goes up {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the relevance goes down. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control? Industrial Designer : 'Cause {disfmarker} Marketing : I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider. If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they {disfmarker} this should be so now Project Manager : Mm-mm. Okay. Marketing : this is of course, depends on that. And um I don't have any conclusion, I didn't have time the meeting was very tight, so that's basically my findings. And uh, if you have any question? Project Manager : Mm I think it's good, okay. You done a good review. User Interface : I got one question, Marketing : I can go back. Industrial Designer : Thank you. Marketing : Yeah one question, User Interface : uh you are a Market Expert Marketing : yeah? User Interface : so Marketing : I am. {vocalsound} User Interface : should we aim at the young people or not? Marketing : I think we should aim at the young people. But uh I think they are {disfmarker} they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device. Industrial Designer : Mm. Marketing : In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people, less than {disfmarker} more than {disfmarker} User Interface : Okay, then teletext is used less. Industrial Designer : Mm. Project Manager : Mm-hmm. Marketing : Then teletext is useless for them I think, User Interface : Okay. Marketing : yeah. Because they they have other means of finding their information. Yeah. Project Manager : Mm-hmm mm mm. Okay. User Interface : Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Project Manager : That's good point.

363,"Hon. Mary Ng (Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank the honourable member for that question. We know that at this time Canada must show leadership in the face of global challenges. More than ever, Canada is playing a positive role by being a champion in diversity and inclusion, supporting the global fight against COVID-19, addressing climate change, leading peace and security efforts and helping the most vulnerable. A seat on the Security Council will allow Canada to be a strong voice for a fairer, more inclusive and prosperous The Chair : We'll go back to Mr. Barrett. Mr. Michael Barrett : Mr. Chair, I received a letter from Bob Anderson this week, who's advocating for his neighbours like Jean Grevelding, who owns a cottage at Butternut Bay. Like many people, Jean is an American who owns a property on our side of the border. These people are taxpaying members of our communities. These folks have plans in place to follow all Canadian quarantine rules. They're concerned about leaving their properties uncared for over the summer. Will folks like Jean be allowed to cross the border to check on their properties this summer? Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) : Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Of course, our priority is and always has been and always must be the protection of the health and safety of Canadians. That's why we put in place these restrictions for non-essential travel and have required, through the Public Health Agency of Canada, a 14-day quarantine. I don't know the specifics of the person for whom you advocate, but we want to make sure that if they come into Canada, it is for an essential purpose and that they do it safely and respect the quarantine that has been put in place. Mr. Michael Barrett : With nine branches throughout my riding, the Royal Canadian Legion offers a great deal to veterans and rural communities alike. They have been experiencing hardship and a loss of revenue, to the point where they may be forced to shut their doors. The Zone G2 commander and local mayors such as Roger Haley have reached out to me expressing their dire need. Will the government offer support to Legions across the country so they can continue to carry out their vital work for our veterans? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Veterans Affairs) : Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Yes, we have done a lot to help support groups like the Legions. There is a $350-million emergency community support fund. If they're supplying any help to people regarding COVID, this fund is there. Indeed, we're doing everything we can to make sure that we help the Legions and other groups that do so much to help veterans right across the country. Mr. Michael Barrett : On May 21, the minister stated that her team was working as quickly as it could to fill the gaps in CEBA. It has now been three weeks, and many business owners, such as mortgage broker Corinna Smith-Gatcke, are still left in the lurch amid the delays, which are pushing businesses closer to shutting their doors for good. Will these businesses have access to CEBA before it's too late for them? Hon. Mary Ng : Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I thank the honourable member for that really important question on our Canadian small businesses. Those businesses can absolutely have access to the loan at their financial institution this Friday, and I would encourage them to go and see their bank or credit union. I want businesses to know that nothing is more important for us than making sure they get the support they need during this difficult time. Mr. Michael Barrett : The County Road 43 expansion project is critical for my riding and the region as a whole. This project will widen the road, increasing safety for the 18,000 motorists who travel the road every day. It's been 334 days since the provincial and local governments announced funding, but there has been nothing from this Liberal government. It's been 181 days since Minister McKenna told me her staff were reviewing the project. Today, there is still nothing, and for the last month the minister's team has not even found the time to respond to my request for an update. Will Minister McKenna finally stop with the delays and commit to funding this project today? Hon. Catherine McKenna (Minister of Infrastructure and Communities) : Mr. Chair, as the member opposite knows, we work with provinces and territories to advance our infrastructure investments. We're making investments across the country. They are making a real difference in people's lives. We're always happy to work with members of Parliament, but they must also work with provinces and territories so that projects are advanced by them to our office. The Chair : We'll now continue with Mrs. Wagantall. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall (YorktonMelville, CPC) : Thank you, Chair. Through you, has Mr. MacAulay read ombudsman Dalton's May 2020 report, Financial Compensation for Canadian Veterans: A comparative analysis of benefit regimes? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Mr. Chair, I apologize, but I'll have to ask my honourable colleague to repeat the question. The Chair : Mrs. Wagantall, we'll freeze the time so that there's no extra time taken. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : Thank you, Chair. My question was whether Mr. MacAulay has read ombudsman Dalton's May 2020 report, Financial Compensation for Canadian Veterans: A comparative analysis of benefit regimes. Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I appreciate my honourable colleague's question. Of course, I appreciate Mr. Dalton's input and all that he has done for veterans. We've discussed it many times. I've done everything and worked with him in order to make sure that we bring the proper compensation to veterans The Chair : We'll go back to Mrs. Wagantall. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : As a result of that study, are the financial outcomes Canada seeks to provide for ill and injured veterans now clearly defined within the Department of Veterans Affairs? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Mr. Chair, as the member would know, I am to bring a report to the veterans affairs committee, and there are a number of things done in order to make sure that report is The Chair : We'll go back to Mrs. Wagantall. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : Then I would suggest that we get our committee up and going as it should be. Where are these financial directions published? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Well, of course, lockdown, but just under $90 million that the government put in supplementary estimates to make sure we address the backlog for Veterans Affairs. It's a major help The Chair : We'll go back to Mrs. Wagantall. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : Minister, are Canadian Armed Forces members provided with a copy of this document? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Mr. Chair, my honourable colleague would have to ask the Canadian Armed Forces that question. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : There are three different providing lifetime benefits for ill and injured veterans. In Ombudsman Dalton's recent report, did any one of these three provide the best compensation in all nine scenarios that were studied? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Of course, as she knows, there's been a lot of work done in order to make sure that we provide the proper compensation to veterans. We're working very hard, with a lot of help from Mr. Dalton, to make sure that the appropriate The Chair : We'll now continue with Mrs. Wagantall. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : In the undisclosed settlement of Sean Bruyea's legal case against Seamus O'Regan and the Liberal government, a joint statement says ...Canadians, especially all Veterans and their families, are encouraged to enter the public debate about policies and programs that affect our Veterans and their families. Does Mr. MacAulay agree with this statement? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : I can assure you that anybody is welcome to enter any discussion on compensation of veterans. We're always open to what we can do in order to make sure that we provide appropriate compensation. I don't think the term would be appropriate, but it would provide some compensation to veterans who truly deserve it. They defend our democracy The Chair : We'll go back to Ms. Wagantall. Oh, I'm sorry Ms. Andranne Larouche : Mr.Chair, I have a point of order. The interpretation hasn't worked for a few interventions. It's difficult to follow the exchange between the hon. member and the minister. The Chair : We're having a problem with the interpretation. Minister and Ms. Wagantall, you are joining us virtually. I'm wondering if you have the right language on at the bottom of your screen. We'll start with that for troubleshooting. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : I have English. The Chair : Very good. Minister MacAulay, what do you have? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : I have English, Mr. Chair. The Chair : Very good. Then we'll check on our side.  Ms.Larouche, did I understand correctly that the interpretation didn't work for both speakers? Ms. Andranne Larouche : The sound didn't allow the interpreters to do their job. It seemed to be a problem with the sound. The Chair : In that case, I would ask both members to maybe put their mike a little bit close to their mouth. We'll see how that works. I'm looking at the screen, and I notice the mike is a little bit far. Could we bend it in a little bit more? I appreciate that. Thank you for your patience. We'll give it another try. Ms. Wagantall, please go ahead. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : On a point of order, quite often while I'm trying to speak, there are lots of other voices in the background. The Chair : I would ask everyone to please be on mute, as well as for anyone in the chamber to please refrain from speaking loudly. Just whisper among yourselves if you have something to say. We'll take this one from the top. We have a minute and 45 seconds left. Ms. Wagantall, please proceed with your next question. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : You said next question, so we're not going backwards, Chair? The Chair : Did we have an answer from Minister MacAulay? No? We'll go to Minister MacAulay to finish up the answer. We'll start at 27 seconds, freeze the clock and hear his answer. Then, because of all of the confusion, we'll start at one minute and 45 seconds when we get going again. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : Should I repeat the question, sir? The Chair : Please do. The clock is frozen. After we go through the question and the answer, we'll start the clock again. Mr. Wagantall, please repeat the question. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : Thank you, Chair. In the undisclosed settlement to Sean Bruyea's legal case against Seamus O'Regan and the Liberal government, a joint statement says, Canadians, especially all Veterans and their families, are encouraged to enter the public debate about policies and programs that affect our Veterans and their families.  Does Mr. MacAulay agree with this statement? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Mr. Chair, I appreciate my honourable colleague's question and concern. Of course I agree. Anybody is quite open to indicate whatever they wish in order to make sure we provide as appropriate a compensation as possible. You can never totally compensate veterans truly for what they deserve, but we want to make sure we provide the best compensation possible. That's what we will do and want to do. The Chair : Ms. Wagantall, we will start the clock again. You have one minute and 45 seconds remaining. Please proceed. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : If that's the case, is Minister MacAulay aware of the practice of red-flagging veterans' files? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Mr. Chair, I'm not aware. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : Since the deputy minister has indicated that he runs the department, will the minister ask him for the names of veterans and the dates and the reasons that they are, or have been, red-flagged by VAC? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Mr. Chair, I would certainly ask any veteran or anybody who has a concern to contact my office. I will do anything I can to make sure that the veterans The Chair : We'll go back to Ms. Wagantall. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : Do the most ill and injured still receive from the pension up to $300,000 less for life? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Mr. Chair, as you know and as the Prime Minister indicated when the pension for life was put in place, it was stated that if anybody receives lessthe Prime Minister himself indicated it quite clearlythat must be adjusted. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : For veterans in similar circumstances, should the date of their application for compensation be a factor in determining whether they're treated equitably? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Yes, of course, the date is when the compensation would start. Of course, it's very important and very appropriate. The Chair : Now we will proceed to Mr. Lloyd. Mr. Dane Lloyd (Sturgeon RiverParkland, CPC) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. Retired Major Mark Campbell in my riding of Sturgeon RiverParkland lost both legs in the line of duty in Afghanistan. He is an avid sport shooter, but understandably, due to his disability, he is very limited in the kinds of firearms he can use, and all of these firearms have now been banned under the Liberal OIC. My question to the Minister of Public Safety is this: Did their department do a legal analysis and consider the section 15 charter rights of disabled Canadians not to be discriminated against when they passed their OIC? Hon. Bill Blair : Yes, there was a very thorough analysis done by the justice department to ensure that the prohibitions we put in place were, in fact, charter compliant. Let me also say, Mr. Chair, how important it was that we prohibited weapons that were not designed for sporting purposes at all. In fact, they were designed for soldiers to use in combat. They have no place in a civil society. We have prohibited them, and we believeand this has been echoed by many people across the countrythat this will make Canadians safer. Mr. Dane Lloyd : Mr. Chair, is the minister aware that the AR-15 is the most popular sporting rifle in Canada, and is he aware that disabled veterans like Major Mark Campbell are unable to participate in the sport of sport shooting because of his OIC? Hon. Bill Blair : I can assure the member that what I am aware of is that the AR-15 and other weapons like them have been used in mass killings in Canada on many occasions, such as at cole Polytechnique, at Dawson College, again at the Quebec mosque and in Moncton. The AR-15s in particular were also used at the terrible tragedy in places like Sandy Hook, where a bunch of kids were killed, so there is no place for","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

Lawrence MacAulay : Well, of course, lockdown, but just under $90 million that the government put in supplementary estimates to make sure we address the backlog for Veterans Affairs. It's a major help The Chair : We'll go back to Mrs. Wagantall. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : Minister, are Canadian Armed Forces members provided with a copy of this document? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Mr. Chair, my honourable colleague would have to ask the Canadian Armed Forces that question. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : There are three different providing lifetime benefits for ill and injured veterans. In Ombudsman Dalton's recent report, did any one of these three provide the best compensation in all nine scenarios that were studied? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Of course, as she knows, there's been a lot of work done in order to make sure that we provide the proper compensation to veterans. We're working very hard, with a lot of help from Mr. Dalton, to make sure that the appropriate The Chair : We'll now continue with Mrs. Wagantall. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : In the undisclosed settlement of Sean Bruyea's legal case against Seamus O'Regan and the Liberal government, a joint statement says...Canadians, especially all Veterans and their families, are encouraged to enter the public debate about policies and programs that affect our Veterans and their families. Does Mr. MacAulay agree with this statement? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : I can assure you that anybody is welcome to enter any discussion on compensation of veterans. We're always open to what we can do in order to make sure that we provide appropriate compensation. I don't think the term would be appropriate, but it would provide some compensation to veterans who truly deserve it. They defend our democracy The Chair : We'll go back to Ms. Wagantall. Oh, I'm sorry Ms. Andranne Larouche : Mr.Chair, I have a point of order. The interpretation hasn't worked for a few interventions. It's difficult to follow the exchange between the hon. member and the minister. The Chair : We're having a problem with the interpretation. Minister and Ms. Wagantall, you are joining us virtually. I'm wondering if you have the right language on at the bottom of your screen. We'll start with that for troubleshooting. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : I have English. The Chair : Very good. Minister MacAulay, what do you have? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : I have English, Mr. Chair. The Chair : Very good. Then we'll check on our side.  Ms.Larouche, did I understand correctly that the interpretation didn't work for both speakers? Ms. Andranne Larouche : The sound didn't allow the interpreters to do their job. It seemed to be a problem with the sound. The Chair : In that case, I would ask both members to maybe put their mike a little bit close to their mouth. We'll see how that works. I'm looking at the screen, and I notice the mike is a little bit far. Could we bend it in a little bit more? I appreciate that. Thank you for your patience. We'll give it another try. Ms. Wagantall, please go ahead. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : On a point of order, quite often while I'm trying to speak, there are lots of other voices in the background. The Chair : I would ask everyone to please be on mute, as well as for anyone in the chamber to please refrain from speaking loudly. Just whisper among yourselves if you have something to say. We'll take this one from the top. We have a minute and 45 seconds left. Ms. Wagantall, please proceed with your next question. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : You said next question, so we're not going backwards, Chair? The Chair : Did we have an answer from Minister MacAulay? No? We'll go to Minister MacAulay to finish up the answer. We'll start at 27 seconds, freeze the clock and hear his answer. Then, because of all of the confusion, we'll start at one minute and 45 seconds when we get going again. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : Should I repeat the question, sir? The Chair : Please do. The clock is frozen. After we go through the question and the answer, we'll start the clock again. Mr. Wagantall, please repeat the question. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : Thank you, Chair. In the undisclosed settlement to Sean Bruyea's legal case against Seamus O'Regan and the Liberal government, a joint statement says, Canadians, especially all Veterans and their families, are encouraged to enter the public debate about policies and programs that affect our Veterans and their families.  Does Mr. MacAulay agree with this statement? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Mr. Chair, I appreciate my honourable colleague's question and concern. Of course I agree. Anybody is quite open to indicate whatever they wish in order to make sure we provide as appropriate a compensation as possible. You can never totally compensate veterans truly for what they deserve, but we want to make sure we provide the best compensation possible. That's what we will do and want to do. The Chair : Ms. Wagantall, we will start the clock again. You have one minute and 45 seconds remaining. Please proceed. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : If that's the case, is Minister MacAulay aware of the practice of red-flagging veterans' files? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Mr. Chair, I'm not aware. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : Since the deputy minister has indicated that he runs the department, will the minister ask him for the names of veterans and the dates and the reasons that they are, or have been, red-flagged by VAC? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Mr. Chair, I would certainly ask any veteran or anybody who has a concern to contact my office. I will do anything I can to make sure that the veterans The Chair : We'll go back to Ms. Wagantall. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : Do the most ill and injured still receive from the pension up to $300,000 less for life? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Mr. Chair, as you know and as the Prime Minister indicated when the pension for life was put in place, it was stated that if anybody receives lessthe Prime Minister himself indicated it quite clearlythat must be adjusted. Mrs. Cathay Wagantall : For veterans in similar circumstances, should the date of their application for compensation be a factor in determining whether they're treated equitably? Hon. Lawrence MacAulay : Yes, of course, the date is when the compensation would start. Of course, it's very important and very appropriate. The Chair : Now we will proceed to Mr. Lloyd. Mr. Dane Lloyd (Sturgeon RiverParkland, CPC) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. Retired Major Mark Campbell in my riding of Sturgeon RiverParkland lost both legs in the line of duty in Afghanistan. He is an avid sport shooter, but understandably, due to his disability, he is very limited in the kinds of firearms he can use, and all of these firearms have now been banned under the Liberal OIC. My question to the Minister of Public Safety is this: Did their department do a legal analysis and consider the section 15 charter rights of disabled Canadians not to be discriminated against when they passed their OIC? Hon. Bill Blair : Yes, there was a very thorough analysis done by the justice department to ensure that the prohibitions we put in place were, in fact, charter compliant. Let me also say, Mr. Chair, how important it was that we prohibited weapons that were not designed for sporting purposes at all. In fact, they were designed for soldiers to use in combat. They have no place in a civil society. We have prohibited them, and we believeand this has been echoed by many people across the countrythat this will make Canadians safer. Mr. Dane Lloyd : Mr. Chair, is the minister aware that the AR-15 is the most popular sporting rifle in Canada, and is he aware that disabled veterans like Major Mark Campbell are unable to participate in the sport of sport shooting because of his OIC? Hon. Bill Blair : I can assure the member that what I am aware of is that the AR-15 and other weapons like them have been used in mass killings in Canada on many occasions, such as at cole Polytechnique, at Dawson College, again at the Quebec mosque and in Moncton. The AR-15s in particular were also used at the terrible tragedy in places like Sandy Hook, where a bunch of kids were killed, so there is no place for Questions: |eot_id|>assistant the AR-15 in a civil society."

Is that an option ? Industrial Designer : Yes . Marketing : {gap} . Project Manager : For you ? Industrial Designer : Although we are demolishing a little bit the style . Marketing : But uh the {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} User Interface : I think the colour is more important than the really the curve , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control {disfmarker} Project Manager : I think it's {disfmarker} it it does ruin it , Marketing : Yeah . The people {disfmarker} Project Manager : but the fact that I t took that decision or t Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um {vocalsound} the possibility of adding your own custom covers . So you can change {gap} any colour you want . So it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want . Industrial Designer : Can we then not also uh change the material ? We take plastic for the basic cover Project Manager : You can take plastic , Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} Project Manager : but I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that {disfmarker} something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of {disfmarker} the spongy feeling of the {disfmarker} Marketing : Spongy , yeah . Industrial Designer : We can put those to the to the other covers . Project Manager : and it really makes it {disfmarker} also makes it different from the existing remote controls , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : because they're all plastic . Marketing : And {disfmarker} Project Manager : So which in in turn {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : That's true . Project Manager : Rubber would increase durability Industrial Designer : But {disfmarker} Project Manager : because it doesn't break . Industrial Designer : okay . But what do you then suggest we'd lose ? Because we have to lose two things and {disfmarker} I guess . Project Manager : I al like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour , Marketing : But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yes . Project Manager : which would make this black a black and grey . Industrial Designer : Okay , and that's enough ? Project Manager : Yeah , that's that that that's enough , because User Interface : So black and grey is okay . Project Manager : I guess those are the basic colours . Marketing : But {disfmarker} Project Manager : So {disfmarker} Oh . User Interface : {vocalsound} Which we can fabricate , Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : I think those are basic col They want to {disfmarker} User Interface : okay . Marketing : The people want to pay for for it , so why why uh {vocalsound} do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ? Project Manager : To ensure the profit . That {disfmarker} that's th that's the order . We're just uh {disfmarker} we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this . Marketing : But we can take a risk . Project Manager : But that's not for our {disfmarker} that's not our decision to take . We have a budget of twelve fifty per product . User Interface : No , we basically {disfmarker} Marketing : Okay , yeah . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : So {disfmarker} User Interface : We need to stick to that . Project Manager : Stick that . I don't think it's really bad either . I mean if we we have the the backup of {disfmarker} or the backup design thing Marketing : I hope the people will like it , Project Manager : to have {disfmarker} Marketing : but {disfmarker} Project Manager : I think they would do . Th I think they do like because yo we {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , Marketing : {gap} {disfmarker} Project Manager : because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect Industrial Designer : Perhaps we should make m Marketing : Yeah . {vocalsound} Project Manager : and keep the functionality between {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . Industrial Designer : Huh . Marketing : The first sheet . Project Manager : So {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . And that's {disfmarker} uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Well I don't think {disfmarker} Yeah . Is it worth {disfmarker} is it is it {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Perhaps they decide tha User Interface : But they don't {disfmarker} Project Manager : does it mean anything to the customer ? Like , it {disfmarker} like , we don't care {disfmarker} we don't care that you had to {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Of course . Perhaps {gap} they uh {disfmarker} no , but perhaps they think uh okay , the cover is such a nice idea , uh let's {disfmarker} that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs . Project Manager : True , Industrial Designer : We ca we uh we can at least tell them that {disfmarker} Project Manager : but we did we didn't get that . So I think it's {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : You don't know that . Project Manager : it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something . User Interface : Well {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Huh . Project Manager : But {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : No , I'm not uh talking about that cost {gap} but the one that g has given us the order to design this . We could at least m uh make it like this , like you said , Project Manager : They could , but uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an {disfmarker} still an option , but {vocalsound} not for this price . Project Manager : It's an option , but {disfmarker} yeah , it's true . So actually uh it's not that much of an increase , but yeah . We cannot contact them . User Interface : And if we {disfmarker} Project Manager : It's just the order that we got . Industrial Designer : Exactly , Project Manager : So that's what we gotta go with . Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : So it's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final , it's either {vocalsound} turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : um or turn it yellow . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's uh something we have to decide on . Industrial Designer : I'd say lose the curve and the colour Project Manager : I say lose the curve . Oh that's true , Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} Project Manager : we could lose the c I forgot that , yeah , sorry . Uh the curve . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : So which curve is that ba Project Manager : That's just this one just d this is the banana curve . User Interface : that's basically that curve . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : So this would this would be straight . User Interface : So we could u still have the comfort . Marketing : Yeah , that's better . Project Manager : No , uh {disfmarker} no , that would be a curve inside the thing , I guess . No , would ju then it would just be a straight remote . Just like {vocalsound} like that . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . {gap} we could make it yellow then , User Interface : I second that . Project Manager : but {disfmarker} You second that , you second that we lose the curve . User Interface : {vocalsound} No , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . Project Manager : Okay , yeah . User Interface : So that's not really that {gap} {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve {vocalsound} to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : So we keep the curve . So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . User Interface : I would {disfmarker} Project Manager : And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Oh . I agree . User Interface : Yeah . I would say {disfmarker} I would agree with you on the colour , Industrial Designer : No . Marketing : Yep . User Interface : because that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Yeah , um User Interface : So we can always do that . Project Manager : I guess people are willing to pay for that . So I think we can take that option and just {disfmarker} with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . Industrial Designer : Hmm ? Marketing : Yeah . {vocalsound} Project Manager : So I think that would still make it a nice product . Industrial Designer : Yes . Project Manager : Okay , we're final on that .

We take plastic for the basic cover Project Manager : You can take plastic, Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} Project Manager : but I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that {disfmarker} something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of {disfmarker} the spongy feeling of the {disfmarker} Marketing : Spongy, yeah. Industrial Designer : We can put those to the to the other covers. Project Manager : and it really makes it {disfmarker} also makes it different from the existing remote controls, Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : because they're all plastic. Marketing : And {disfmarker} Project Manager : So which in in turn {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : That's true. Project Manager : Rubber would increase durability Industrial Designer : But {disfmarker} Project Manager : because it doesn't break. Industrial Designer : okay. But what do you then suggest we'd lose? Because we have to lose two things and {disfmarker} I guess. Project Manager : I al like I said, I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour, Marketing : But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yes. Project Manager : which would make this black a black and grey. Industrial Designer : Okay, and that's enough? Project Manager : Yeah, that's that that that's enough, because User Interface : So black and grey is okay. Project Manager : I guess those are the basic colours. Marketing : But {disfmarker} Project Manager : So {disfmarker} Oh. User Interface : {vocalsound} Which we can fabricate, Industrial Designer : Hmm. Project Manager : I think those are basic col They want to {disfmarker} User Interface : okay. Marketing : The people want to pay for for it, so why why uh {vocalsound} do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half? Project Manager : To ensure the profit. That {disfmarker} that's th that's the order. We're just uh {disfmarker} we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this. Marketing : But we can take a risk. Project Manager : But that's not for our {disfmarker} that's not our decision to take. We have a budget of twelve fifty per product. User Interface : No, we basically {disfmarker} Marketing : Okay, yeah. Industrial Designer : Hmm. Project Manager : So {disfmarker} User Interface : We need to stick to that. Project Manager : Stick that. I don't think it's really bad either. I mean if we we have the the backup of {disfmarker} or the backup design thing Marketing : I hope the people will like it, Project Manager : to have {disfmarker} Marketing : but {disfmarker} Project Manager : I think they would do. Th I think they do like because yo we {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea, Marketing : {gap} {disfmarker} Project Manager : because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product, one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want. Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect Industrial Designer : Perhaps we should make m Marketing : Yeah. {vocalsound} Project Manager : and keep the functionality between {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget. Industrial Designer : Huh. Marketing : The first sheet. Project Manager : So {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost. And that's {disfmarker} uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost, that they know that. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Well I don't think {disfmarker} Yeah. Is it worth {disfmarker} is it is it {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Perhaps they decide tha User Interface : But they don't {disfmarker} Project Manager : does it mean anything to the customer? Like, it {disfmarker} like, we don't care {disfmarker} we don't care that you had to {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Of course. Perhaps {gap} they uh {disfmarker} no, but perhaps they think uh okay, the cover is such a nice idea, uh let's {disfmarker} that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs. Project Manager : True, Industrial Designer : We ca we uh we can at least tell them that {disfmarker} Project Manager : but we did we didn't get that. So I think it's {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : You don't know that. Project Manager : it should either be a pack, maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something. User Interface : Well {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Huh. Project Manager : But {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : No, I'm not uh talking about that cost {gap} but the one that g has given us the order to design this. We could at least m uh make it like this, like you said, Project Manager : They could, but uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : and then tell them okay, we had to drop this and that, just that you know. It is an {disfmarker} still an option, but {vocalsound} not for this price. Project Manager : It's an option, but {disfmarker} yeah, it's true. So actually uh it's not that much of an increase, but yeah. We cannot contact them. User Interface : And if we {disfmarker} Project Manager : It's just the order that we got. Industrial Designer : Exactly, Project Manager : So that's what we gotta go with. Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : So it's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final, it's either {vocalsound} turned into plastic, drop the squishy feel, make it make it more breakable, Marketing : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Hmm. Project Manager : um or turn it yellow. So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's uh something we have to decide on. Industrial Designer : I'd say lose the curve and the colour Project Manager : I say lose the curve. Oh that's true, Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} Project Manager : we could lose the c I forgot that, yeah, sorry. Uh the curve. So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : So which curve is that ba Project Manager : That's just this one just d this is the banana curve. User Interface : that's basically that curve. Industrial Designer : Hmm. Project Manager : So this would this would be straight. User Interface : So we could u still have the comfort. Marketing : Yeah, that's better. Project Manager : No, uh {disfmarker} no, that would be a curve inside the thing, I guess. No, would ju then it would just be a straight remote. Just like {vocalsound} like that. Industrial Designer : Hmm. Project Manager : Which would, yeah, turn it into something far more ordinary. {gap} we could make it yellow then, User Interface : I second that. Project Manager : but {disfmarker} You second that, you second that we lose the curve. User Interface : {vocalsound} No, that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control. Project Manager : Okay, yeah. User Interface : So that's not really that {gap} {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah. Yeah. Project Manager : So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve {vocalsound} to separate it from the rest of the remote control world, so to speak. Industrial Designer : Hmm. Project Manager : So we keep the curve. So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber. User Interface : I would {disfmarker} Project Manager : And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber, because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Oh. I agree. User Interface : Yeah. I would say {disfmarker} I would agree with you on the colour, Industrial Designer : No. Marketing : Yep. User Interface : because that's an extra option, an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money. Project Manager : Mm-hmm. Yeah, um User Interface : So we can always do that. Project Manager : I guess people are willing to pay for that. So I think we can take that option and just {disfmarker} with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control. Industrial Designer : Hmm? Marketing : Yeah. {vocalsound} Project Manager : So I think that would still make it a nice product. Industrial Designer : Yes. Project Manager : Okay, we're final on that. So {vocalsound} it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing. But anyways we're here. Um yeah. Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"
411,"Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you, Chair. You touched on this once or twice in answers to questions about how rigorous the qualification is. We've had mixed evidence, I would suggest, from groups of stakeholders. We've heard people say that the Welsh bac has no rigour, that pupils are spoon-fed. We've heard that the Welsh bac is passively marked, the grades are inflated, that there's little rigour in the sampling and moderation, there's a confusion about how the SCC is graded, and I know that's something you talked about, actually, that introducing the grading system is improving the rigour. I suppose my question to you is: if the Welsh bac is being seen in this way by stakeholders, how are going to address that? To what extent is that a real problem? Kirsty Williams AM : I think making it a graded qualification has been really important, and I make no apologies for this qualification being rigorous—no apologies for that at all. That's how it should be, and that's how you create value, by ensuring that a qualification is rigorous. What's really important is that it's not just me saying that it's rigorous; there is an independent process that benchmarks qualifications. The fact is that at advanced level—because I don't know if you're making these observations about the pre-16 Welsh bac, or whether we're talking about the advanced level qualification—that is the equivalent of an A-level. It's been benchmarked against A-levels. It has a UCAS tariff associated with it. It is used by universities as a means of qualification that gains entrance into a university in just the same way as an A-level is. So, therefore, I don't have any concerns about the rigour of the qualification. In terms of spoon-feeding, one of the reasons why universities like the qualification is that it's very difficult, for instance, in the individual project work to be spoon-fed. It is very demanding of individual students, and it's very difficult in a way. That's one of the reasons why it's valuable, isn't it, because it teaches a different set of skills? Because if you're doing a traditional, say, history A-level or a science A-level, there's a very strict syllabus and a course, there's a textbook and people are taught to that particular syllabus; with the Welsh bac, it is individual students that have to think, for instance, of their own individual project. You can't get those off a shelf, and you can't necessarily just find that information easily. There's real skill involved in being able to do that well and get graded well for that. So, I do not have concerns about the rigour. I do have concerns about some of the feedback by Qualifications Wales about the onerousness of the evaluation and what that means for teacher workload, which is one of the things that Qualifications Wales is looking at. But in terms of rigour and people being spoon-fed, then I don't share those concerns. Dawn Bowden AM : Okay, because those were concerns, in the main, that were articulated by people delivering the Welsh bac—by teachers. So, I suppose the question then comes back to some of the other points that were being raised about the consistency, because that may well be from those teachers in schools where they're not taking the bac as seriously as some others are. Kirsty Williams AM : And, of course, there would be—. There is a professional responsibility for those teachers delivering that qualification to ensure that the ethos of that qualification and the skills—. It would potentially be a disservice to students if that qualification was being delivered in that way. Dawn Bowden AM : And I think what I was trying to do was to highlight the different opinions, because we also heard from teachers who were saying that those involved with teaching and studying understood absolutely its rigour, so it was the mixed message, I guess, I was just trying to test out with you. Similarly, on the skills challenge certificate, again we've heard from various stakeholders about whether, in fact, this is considered to be an equivalent qualification. We've heard people say that it is different—it's not the same as an A-level—so, therefore you can't absolutely hold it up and say it's the same as an A-level. It requires different skills, and so on and so forth. So, just your thoughts and views on that, really, as an equivalent qualification. Kirsty Williams AM : It's not a question of if this is an equivalent qualification; this is an equivalent qualification. There is a rigorous process that is undertaken to evaluate these qualifications independent of the Government, and it's not a question. Is it a different model and a different way of studying? Yes, of course it is, and that's why we do it. That's why I want children and young people to do both sets of qualifications, because it does engage and expand the acquisition of knowledge and skills. So, yes, it's different. Is it equivalent? Yes, it is, and that's why, since the graded qualification came in, it is regarded by independent bodies as an equivalent to an A-level, and it has a tariff for UCAS in the same way as A-levels would have tariffs. You only have to speak to the institutes of higher education who use this qualification as a way of setting grades—you know, offers—for students that they see that in the same way as well. Dawn Bowden AM : Okay.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions. The questions should be diverse and should ask about different aspects related to the document. No two questions should be asking about the same thing and each question should be a wh-question.

431,"Project Manager : Alright . And we'll turn to the next presentation . I think she said we don't need to screw it in , just stick it in . And then press , what ? F F_N_ and F_ eight . Next to the control button on the bottom , and then F_ eight at the top . User Interface : Yeah , press them . Project Manager : And then w be patient . {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah , here we go . Project Manager : Tada . Industrial Designer : And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there . User Interface : Can I not just uh do each one in order ? Industrial Designer : I you can if you like , it it {disfmarker} that that just sets it up to do a p a p Project Manager : There we are . Yay . User Interface : That ? Industrial Designer : no that one , that one there . User Interface : That ? Industrial Designer : Left , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep . User Interface : That ? Right , technical functions design . Uh well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control . Project Manager : T_V_ only . User Interface : So these are two models of existing remote controls . Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Ugh . User Interface : It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . It also has {disfmarker} seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control Project Manager : Hmm . User Interface : where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has {disfmarker} it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access {disfmarker} it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . Project Manager : Mm . And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us . User Interface : So it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just {disfmarker} want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : o I was thinking something {disfmarker} some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access . Project Manager : Alright . User Interface : Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility . Project Manager : Okay . Any uh thing else you wanna add ? User Interface : No . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : But we could go back to the pictures of the {disfmarker} uh , what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , Marketing : Or if {disfmarker} User Interface : but {vocalsound} maybe should hear what Kate has to say first . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Let's hear what Kate has to say . User Interface : Okay then . Marketing : Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that {disfmarker} your {disfmarker} the one on the right as a as a basis . Project Manager : Hmm . Marketing : Whiteboard session . Project Manager : I think the white {disfmarker} that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Definitely less cluttered and {disfmarker} I mean but still it's {disfmarker} Project Manager : It's there User Interface : Sorry Project Manager : but it's {disfmarker} User Interface : I was just {disfmarker} I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say . Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : The the style of these is terrible . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : {vocalsound} I I I really think we need to uh not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . {vocalsound} Marketing : The ergonomics , the way it fits in your {disfmarker} Project Manager : Hmm . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : But {disfmarker} Project Manager : {gap} User Interface : So that's that for now . Industrial Designer : Cheers . Mm , I haven't actually got a display on my screen . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Still , I'll do without that . Okay um , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . {vocalsound} Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . Um basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , {vocalsound} and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . So , let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . {vocalsound} And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and {disfmarker} which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the {disfmarker} which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . Now I would have hoped {disfmarker} I think that's my only slide actually , yeah . I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . {vocalsound} So we want an energy source which is there . And we've got to think about what that might be . Project Manager : Hmm-mm . Industrial Designer : Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . Uh typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions . {vocalsound} Um and then we have the the user interface . Oops . And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . So those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty . {vocalsound} Thank you . Project Manager : Hmm . {vocalsound} Okay . Right . But those things {disfmarker} as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of {disfmarker} what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ? Uh what does it feel like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? Um is there any um {disfmarker} because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? Industrial Designer : Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . We're trying to sell four million of 'em , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : um that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing , Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay . Industrial Designer : you just {disfmarker} if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need {disfmarker} gonna need to hit . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Whoop . Marketing : Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? User Interface : {vocalsound} Isn't that your job ? Marketing : Because then {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Oh . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : No , User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh right . Marketing : the chip composer marketing . Oh no , the chip composer sender . Project Manager : Mm . What they cost . Industrial Designer : Um , I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna {vocalsound} give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , Marketing : I I don't believe I know , um . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay . Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . User Interface : Yeah . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the {disfmarker} which is pretty much the same as these existing models , Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : just maybe a little bit more inspired , Marketing : Inspired ? User Interface : but basically just the same . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all . Could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . User Interface : You could {disfmarker} you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , Marketing : Well User Interface : which are {disfmarker} Marketing : that has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you {disfmarker} then it has a place . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : You'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah . Marketing : Yeah , but it also has a place , User Interface : And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . Marketing : so {disfmarker} exactly . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : {vocalsound} But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . Marketing : {vocalsound} That's a really good idea . Industrial Designer : Well I uh think that's a very interesting idea , but um I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . {vocalsound} I'll do some research for the next meeting . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Well it's better than my idea about solar , probably . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Uh yeah . Industrial Designer : Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : Well it is just so annoying how {disfmarker} Marketing : Depen Project Manager : It would have to sor store up the energy Marketing : Mm . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , I guess . Project Manager : and then use it . Solar can do that . Industrial Designer : We may be talking quite heavy then . Project Manager : M yeah , that would be too heavy Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : and it'd cost too much . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably {disfmarker} I mean it might cost more to {disfmarker} at first to develop and to install , Marketing : Mm-hmm User Interface : but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer Marketing : Mm-hmm .

Marketing : Exactly . User Interface : Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range . Project Manager : Hmm . Marketing : Mm .

Do not provide anything else other than generated questions separaterd by commas. Document: Project Manager : Alright. And we'll turn to the next presentation. I think she said we don't need to screw it in, just stick it in. And then press, what? F F_N_ and F_ eight. Next to the control button on the bottom, and then F_ eight at the top. User Interface : Yeah, press them. Project Manager : And then w be patient. {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah, here we go. Project Manager : Tada. Industrial Designer : And if you want it to go into slide show mode, it's that little button there. User Interface : Can I not just uh do each one in order? Industrial Designer : I you can if you like, it it {disfmarker} that that just sets it up to do a p a p Project Manager : There we are. Yay. User Interface : That? Industrial Designer : no that one, that one there. User Interface : That? Industrial Designer : Left, left a bit, left a bit, that one, yep. User Interface : That? Right, technical functions design. Uh well I think first off, basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah. I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions. So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have. And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have. If we can build on this with the speech recognition, that's not something I'd thought about at all, but it's also something we can discuss. Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control, if this is only gonna be a, you know, satellite, cable, T_V_ remote control. Project Manager : T_V_ only. User Interface : So these are two models of existing remote controls. Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Ugh. User Interface : It has fast-forward, stop, play, all relating to movies. It also has {disfmarker} seems to have channel up and channel down, which is which is more what you'd expect from a, you know, like a Sky or cable remote control Project Manager : Hmm. User Interface : where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one. Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right, which has {disfmarker} it also has play, stop and pause and everything, I don't think we need them at all. I think we just need channel selection, volume up, volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access {disfmarker} it's not like teletext, but along the same lines, access things on the screen. Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned, because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do. Project Manager : Mm. And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us. User Interface : So it really exceed the requirements, 'cause the requirements really are just {disfmarker} want to be able to change channels and functions, which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : o I was thinking something {disfmarker} some smooth, sleek, little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access. Project Manager : Alright. User Interface : Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility. Project Manager : Okay. Any uh thing else you wanna add? User Interface : No. Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : But we could go back to the pictures of the {disfmarker} uh, what're they called? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them, Marketing : Or if {disfmarker} User Interface : but {vocalsound} maybe should hear what Kate has to say first. Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : Yeah. Let's hear what Kate has to say. User Interface : Okay then. Marketing : Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that {disfmarker} your {disfmarker} the one on the right as a as a basis. Project Manager : Hmm. Marketing : Whiteboard session. Project Manager : I think the white {disfmarker} that one on the right is, as well as less cluttered, {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Marketing : Mm-hmm. User Interface : Definitely less cluttered and {disfmarker} I mean but still it's {disfmarker} Project Manager : It's there User Interface : Sorry Project Manager : but it's {disfmarker} User Interface : I was just {disfmarker} I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say. Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : The the style of these is terrible. Project Manager : Yeah. User Interface : {vocalsound} I I I really think we need to uh not only possibly even materials, like the type of plastic used, but everything including size and shape of buttons, positioning of buttons, the actual shape of the hand-held device, colours, just every e yeah, everything to do with this has to be revolutionised. {vocalsound} Marketing : The ergonomics, the way it fits in your {disfmarker} Project Manager : Hmm. Marketing : Yeah. User Interface : But {disfmarker} Project Manager : {gap} User Interface : So that's that for now. Industrial Designer : Cheers. Mm, I haven't actually got a display on my screen. Project Manager : Okay. Industrial Designer : Still, I'll do without that. Okay um, now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work. {vocalsound} Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting. Um basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research, {vocalsound} and if I had a design team, I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em. But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you. So, let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is. It's for sending a message, um typically um via infrared. {vocalsound} And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source, the user interface and {disfmarker} which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the {disfmarker} which buttons the user presses, we turn that into a message, um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver. Now I would have hoped {disfmarker} I think that's my only slide actually, yeah. I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design, but unfortunately the technology defeated me, so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard. {vocalsound} So we want an energy source which is there. And we've got to think about what that might be. Project Manager : Hmm-mm. Industrial Designer : Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing. Uh typically it would be a battery, but I'm open to suggestions. {vocalsound} Um and then we have the the user interface. Oops. And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message, which it then transfers to some sending mechanism, which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver. So those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty. {vocalsound} Thank you. Project Manager : Hmm. {vocalsound} Okay. Right. But those things {disfmarker} as long as we can get those components, the block, that that rectangle for the user interface, is where the user comes in of {disfmarker} what what does it look like? What do the buttons look like? Uh what does it feel like? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own. Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there, but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong. For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip, for whatever reason, breaks down after a certain amount of time, do you just replace it? Um is there any um {disfmarker} because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces, like for D_V_D_s, movies, whatever. Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others, in a different frequency or something? Industrial Designer : Well I may be wrong here, but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device. We're trying to sell four million of 'em, Project Manager : Mm. Industrial Designer : um that's that's, you know, that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is. Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing, Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay. Industrial Designer : you just {disfmarker} if it goes wrong you chuck it out, and that's why I'm a bit concerned. I like the idea of speech recognition, that's a great idea, but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need {disfmarker} gonna need to hit. Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : Whoop. Marketing : Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements? User Interface : {vocalsound} Isn't that your job? Marketing : Because then {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Oh. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : No, User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh right. Marketing : the chip composer marketing. Oh no, the chip composer sender. Project Manager : Mm. What they cost. Industrial Designer : Um, I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna {vocalsound} give me some advice on that, if you're asking me, Marketing : I I don't believe I know, um. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay. Marketing : Okay. Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea. User Interface : Yeah. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Mm. Industrial Designer : Yeah. User Interface : It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced, the {disfmarker} which is pretty much the same as these existing models, Marketing : Mm-hmm. User Interface : just maybe a little bit more inspired, Marketing : Inspired? User Interface : but basically just the same. Marketing : Mm. User Interface : Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is, you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all. Could it be possible to have uh, you know, like a rechargeable internal battery, like, well, like an M_P_ three player does? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever. Marketing : Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. User Interface : You could {disfmarker} you know, you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours, and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages, and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries, Marketing : Well User Interface : which are {disfmarker} Marketing : that has another element, which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger, then you {disfmarker} then it has a place. Project Manager : Mm. User Interface : You'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah. Marketing : Yeah, but it also has a place, User Interface : And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa. Marketing : so {disfmarker} exactly. Project Manager : Mm. User Interface : {vocalsound} But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not. Marketing : {vocalsound} That's a really good idea. Industrial Designer : Well I uh think that's a very interesting idea, but um I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost. {vocalsound} I'll do some research for the next meeting. Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Well it's better than my idea about solar, probably. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Uh yeah. Industrial Designer : Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night, Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah, yeah. Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} Project Manager : Mm. User Interface : Well it is just so annoying how {disfmarker} Marketing : Depen Project Manager : It would have to sor store up the energy Marketing : Mm. Yeah. Industrial Designer : Yeah, I guess. Project Manager : and then use it. Solar can do that. Industrial Designer : We may be talking quite heavy then. Project Manager : M yeah, that would be too heavy Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : and it'd cost too much. Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm. User Interface : No, but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably {disfmarker} I mean it might cost more to {disfmarker} at first to develop and to install, Marketing : Mm-hmm User Interface : but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer Marketing : Mm-hmm. User Interface : and Industrial Designer : So do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop? User Interface : you know f Marketing : Definitely, Project Manager : Mm. Marketing : 'cause I'm thinking in terms of um uh {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} loss and breakage of um remotes, how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home, a um a nest, a place to live, User Interface : Mm. Project Manager : Mm. User Interface : Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : exactly. Project Manager : Yeah. Marketing : So if you can dock it, um you know, you could s argue that this is {disfmarker} Project Manager : And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent.

If the Liberal Party of Canada had not taken advantage of the emergency programs, would it have laid off all its staff? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair, we recognized that a number of organizations and companies were facing difficulties because of COVID-19. People work for those organizations, as accountants, receptionists, assistants or labourers, and those people need to be supported. We are supporting people all over the country through that program.

PhD G : Seniority . Professor D : But . But . Um . You know , the other thing I was thinking was that , {pause} um {pause} these {disfmarker} all these interesting questions are , of course , pretty hard to answer with , uh u {pause} you know , a small amount of data . Grad H : Ach . Professor D : So , um {pause} I wonder if what you 're saying suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have , um {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} a fair number of meetings with , uh a smaller number of people . Right ? I mean {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} most of our meetings are {pause} uh , meetings currently with say five , six , seven , eight people Should we {pause} really try to have some two - person meetings , {pause} or some three - person meetings and re record them {vocalsound} just to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to beef up the {disfmarker} the statistics on that ? Postdoc F : That 's a control . Well , {vocalsound} it seems like there are two possibilities there , I mean {pause} i it seems like {vocalsound} if you have just {pause} two people it 's not {pause} really , y like a meeting , w is not as similar as the rest of the {disfmarker} {pause} of the sample . It depends on what you 're after , of course , but {vocalsound} It seems like that would be more a case of the control condition , compared to , uh {pause} an experimental {pause} condition , with more than two . Grad H : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Well , Liz was raising the question of {disfmarker} of whether i it 's the number {disfmarker} there 's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there , Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . Professor D : and , um {vocalsound} If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you 'd still have the visuals . You wouldn't have that difference {pause} also that you have in the {vocalsound} say , in Switchboard data . Uh Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . Yeah , I 'm just thinking that 'd be more like a c control condition . Professor D : Yeah . Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . PhD E : Yeah . Grad H : Well , but from the acoustic point of view , it 's all good . PhD E : Is the same . Professor D : Yeah , acoustic is fine , but {disfmarker} PhD G : If {disfmarker} if the goal were to just look at overlap you would {disfmarker} you could serve yourself {disfmarker} save yourself a lot of time but not even transcri transcribe the words . PhD B : Well , I was thinking you should be able to do this from the {pause} acoustics , on the close - talking mikes , Grad H : Yep . Professor D : Yeah . Grad H : Well , that 's {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} that was my {disfmarker} my status report , PhD B : right ? Postdoc F : You 've been working on that . PhD B : Right , I mean Adam was {disfmarker} PhD E : Yeah . Postdoc F : Yeah . Grad H : so {vocalsound} {pause} Once we 're done with this stuff discussing , PhD B : right . I mean , not as well as what {disfmarker} I mean , you wouldn't be able to have any kind of typology , obviously , Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : but you 'd get some rough statistics . Grad H : Mm - hmm . PhD B : So . Professor D : But {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what do you think about that ? Do you think that would be useful ? I 'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two - person meetings or something . PhD B : I guess my {disfmarker} my first comment was , um {pause} only that {vocalsound} um we should n not attribute overlaps only to meetings , but maybe that 's obvious , maybe everybody knew that , Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : but that {vocalsound} in normal conversation with two people there 's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap , and that it would be interesting to look at {pause} whether there are these kinds of constraints that Jane mentioned , that {vocalsound} what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : you know , because now you can have five people trying to grab the turn , but pretty quickly there 're {disfmarker} they back off and you go back to this sort of only one person at a time with one person interrupting at a time . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : So , I don't know . To answer your question I {pause} it {disfmarker} I don't think it 's crucial to have controls but I think it 's worth recording all the meetings we {pause} can . Grad H : Can . PhD B : So , um {pause} you know . Professor D : Well , {vocalsound} OK . PhD E : Yeah . PhD G : I {disfmarker} I have an idea . PhD B : D I wouldn't not record a two - person meeting just because it only has two people . Grad H : Right . PhD G : Could we {disfmarker} Could we , um {disfmarker} we have {disfmarker} have in the past and I think continue {disfmarker} will continue to have a fair number of {pause} uh phone conference calls . Professor D : Uh - huh . PhD G : And , {vocalsound} uh , {pause} and as a {disfmarker} to , um {vocalsound} as another c {pause} c comparison {pause} condition , {pause} we could um see what {disfmarker} what what happens in terms of overlap , when you don't have visual contact . Grad H : Yeah , we talked about this repeatedly . PhD G : So , um {disfmarker} PhD B : Can we actually record ? Grad H : It just seems like that 's a very different {pause} thing than what we 're doing . Professor D : Uh Well , we 'll have to set up for it . PhD B : I mean {pause} physically {pause} can we record the o the other {disfmarker} Professor D : Yeah . Well , we 're not really set up for it {pause} to do that . But . PhD G : Or , this is getting a little extravagant , we could put up some kind of blinds or something to {disfmarker} {pause} to remove , uh {pause} visual contact . Professor D : Yeah . PhD C : Yeah . Grad H : Barriers ! PhD B : That 's what they did on Map Task , you know , this Map Task corpus ? They ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without visual cues and it 's quite interesting . Professor D : Well , we {disfmarker} we record this meeting so regularly it wouldn't be that {disfmarker} I mean {pause} a little strange . Grad H : OK , we can record , but no one can look at each other . PhD B : Well , we could just put {pause} b blindfolds on . PhD C : Yeah .

PhD G : Seniority. Professor D : But. But. Um. You know, the other thing I was thinking was that, {pause} um {pause} these {disfmarker} all these interesting questions are, of course, pretty hard to answer with, uh u {pause} you know, a small amount of data. Grad H : Ach. Professor D : So, um {pause} I wonder if what you're saying suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have, um {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} a fair number of meetings with, uh a smaller number of people. Right? I mean {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} most of our meetings are {pause} uh, meetings currently with say five, six, seven, eight people Should we {pause} really try to have some two - person meetings, {pause} or some three - person meetings and re record them {vocalsound} just to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to beef up the {disfmarker} the statistics on that? Postdoc F : That's a control. Well, {vocalsound} it seems like there are two possibilities there, I mean {pause} i it seems like {vocalsound} if you have just {pause} two people it's not {pause} really, y like a meeting, w is not as similar as the rest of the {disfmarker} {pause} of the sample. It depends on what you're after, of course, but {vocalsound} It seems like that would be more a case of the control condition, compared to, uh {pause} an experimental {pause} condition, with more than two. Grad H : Mm - hmm. Professor D : Well, Liz was raising the question of {disfmarker} of whether i it's the number {disfmarker} there's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there, Postdoc F : Mm - hmm. Professor D : and, um {vocalsound} If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you 'd still have the visuals. You wouldn't have that difference {pause} also that you have in the {vocalsound} say, in Switchboard data. Uh Postdoc F : Mm - hmm. Yeah, I'm just thinking that 'd be more like a c control condition. Professor D : Yeah. Postdoc F : Mm - hmm. PhD E : Yeah. Grad H : Well, but from the acoustic point of view, it's all good. PhD E : Is the same. Professor D : Yeah, acoustic is fine, but {disfmarker} PhD G : If {disfmarker} if the goal were to just look at overlap you would {disfmarker} you could serve yourself {disfmarker} save yourself a lot of time but not even transcri transcribe the words. PhD B : Well, I was thinking you should be able to do this from the {pause} acoustics, on the close - talking mikes, Grad H : Yep. Professor D : Yeah. Grad H : Well, that's {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} that was my {disfmarker} my status report, PhD B : right? Postdoc F : You've been working on that. PhD B : Right, I mean Adam was {disfmarker} PhD E : Yeah. Postdoc F : Yeah. Grad H : so {vocalsound} {pause} Once we're done with this stuff discussing, PhD B : right. I mean, not as well as what {disfmarker} I mean, you wouldn't be able to have any kind of typology, obviously, Professor D : Yeah. PhD B : but you 'd get some rough statistics. Grad H : Mm - hmm. PhD B : So. Professor D : But {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what do you think about that? Do you think that would be useful? I'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two - person meetings or something. PhD B : I guess my {disfmarker} my first comment was, um {pause} only that {vocalsound} um we should n not attribute overlaps only to meetings, but maybe that's obvious, maybe everybody knew that, Professor D : Yeah. PhD B : but that {vocalsound} in normal conversation with two people there's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap, and that it would be interesting to look at {pause} whether there are these kinds of constraints that Jane mentioned, that {vocalsound} what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn, Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD B : you know, because now you can have five people trying to grab the turn, but pretty quickly there're {disfmarker} they back off and you go back to this sort of only one person at a time with one person interrupting at a time. Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD B : So, I don't know. To answer your question I {pause} it {disfmarker} I don't think it's crucial to have controls but I think it's worth recording all the meetings we {pause} can. Grad H : Can. PhD B : So, um {pause} you know. Professor D : Well, {vocalsound} OK. PhD E : Yeah. PhD G : I {disfmarker} I have an idea. PhD B : D I wouldn't not record a two - person meeting just because it only has two people. Grad H : Right. PhD G : Could we {disfmarker} Could we, um {disfmarker} we have {disfmarker} have in the past and I think continue {disfmarker} will continue to have a fair number of {pause} uh phone conference calls. Professor D : Uh - huh. PhD G : And, {vocalsound} uh, {pause} and as a {disfmarker} to, um {vocalsound} as another c {pause} c comparison {pause} condition, {pause} we could um see what {disfmarker} what what happens in terms of overlap, when you don't have visual contact. Grad H : Yeah, we talked about this repeatedly. PhD G : So, um {disfmarker} PhD B : Can we actually record? Grad H : It just seems like that's a very different {pause} thing than what we're doing. Professor D : Uh Well, we 'll have to set up for it. PhD B : I mean {pause} physically {pause} can we record the o the other {disfmarker} Professor D : Yeah. Well, we're not really set up for it {pause} to do that. But. PhD G : Or, this is getting a little extravagant, we could put up some kind of blinds or something to {disfmarker} {pause} to remove, uh {pause} visual contact. Professor D : Yeah. PhD C : Yeah. Grad H : Barriers! PhD B : That's what they did on Map Task, you know, this Map Task corpus? They ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without visual cues and it's quite interesting. Professor D : Well, we {disfmarker} we record this meeting so regularly it wouldn't be that {disfmarker} I mean {pause} a little strange. Grad H : OK, we can record, but no one can look at each other. PhD B : Well, we could just put {pause} b blindfolds on. PhD C : Yeah. PhD G : Well y no you {disfmarker} f Grad H : Close your eyes.

Per - e s s someone told that perhaps it 's not fair to do that because the , um {disfmarker} to make a good VAD {pause} you don't have enough to {disfmarker} with the {disfmarker} the features that are {disfmarker} the baseline features . So {disfmarker} mmm , you need more features . So you really need to put more {disfmarker} more in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the front - end . Professor B : Yeah . PhD A : So i Professor B : Um , PhD A : S Professor B : sure . But i bu PhD C : Wait a minute . I {disfmarker} I 'm confused . PhD A : Yeah . PhD C : Wha - what do you mean ? PhD A : Yeah , if i Professor B : So y so you m s Yeah , but {disfmarker} Well , let 's say for ins see , MFCC for instance doesn't have anything in it , uh , related to the pitch . So just {disfmarker} just for example . So suppose you 've {disfmarker} that {vocalsound} what you really wanna do is put a good pitch detector on there and if it gets an unambiguous {disfmarker} PhD C : Oh , oh . I see . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : if it gets an unambiguous result then you 're definitely in a {disfmarker} in a {disfmarker} in a voice in a , uh , s region with speech . Uh . PhD C : So there 's this assumption that the v the voice activity detector can only use the MFCC ? PhD A : That 's not clear , but this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} e Professor B : Well , for the baseline . PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : So {disfmarker} so if you use other features then y But it 's just a question of what is your baseline . Right ? What is it that you 're supposed to do better than ? PhD C : I g Yeah . Professor B : And so having the baseline be the MFCC 's {pause} means that people could {pause} choose to pour their ener their effort into trying to do a really good VAD PhD C : I don't s But they seem like two {pause} separate issues . Professor B : or tryi They 're sort of separate . PhD C : Right ? I mean {disfmarker} Professor B : Unfortunately there 's coupling between them , which is part of what I think Stephane is getting to , is that {vocalsound} you can choose your features in such a way as to improve the VAD . PhD A : Yeah . Professor B : And you also can choose your features in such a way as to prove {disfmarker} improve recognition . They may not be the same thing . PhD C : But it seems like you should do both . Professor B : You should do both PhD C : Right ? Professor B : and {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} I think that this still makes {disfmarker} I still think this makes sense as a baseline . It 's just saying , as a baseline , we know {disfmarker} PhD A : Mmm . Professor B : you know , we had the MFCC 's before , lots of people have done voice activity detectors , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : you might as well pick some voice activity detector and make that the baseline , just like you picked some version of HTK and made that the baseline . PhD A : Yeah . Right . Professor B : And then {pause} let 's try and make everything better . Um , and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features {pause} be better features for the VAD then that 's {disfmarker} so be it . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : But , uh , uh , uh , at least you have a starting point that 's {disfmarker} um , cuz i i some of {disfmarker} the some of the people didn't have a VAD at all , I guess . Right ? And {disfmarker} and PhD A : Yeah . Professor B : then they {disfmarker} they looked pretty bad and {disfmarker} and in fact what they were doing wasn't so bad at all . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor B : But , um . PhD C : Yeah . It seems like you should try to make your baseline as good as possible . And if it turns out that {pause} you can't improve on that , well , I mean , then , you know , nobody wins and you just use MFCC . Right ? Professor B : Yeah . I mean , it seems like , uh , it should include sort of the current state of the art {vocalsound} that you want {disfmarker} are trying to improve , and MFCC 's , you know , or PLP or something {disfmarker} it seems like {vocalsound} reasonable baseline for the features , and anybody doing this task , {vocalsound} uh , is gonna have some sort of voice activity detection at some level , in some way . They might use the whole recognizer to do it {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} rather than {vocalsound} a separate thing , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but they 'll have it on some level . So , um . PhD C : It seems like whatever they choose they shouldn't , {vocalsound} you know , purposefully brain - damage a part of the system to {pause} make a worse baseline , or {disfmarker} Professor B : Well , I think people just had PhD C : You know ? Professor B : it wasn't that they purposely brain - damaged it . I think people hadn't really thought through {vocalsound} about the , uh {disfmarker} the VAD issue . PhD C : Mmm . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : And {disfmarker} and then when the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the proposals actually came in and half of them had V A Ds and half of them didn't , and the half that did did well and the {vocalsound} half that didn't did poorly . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : So it 's {disfmarker} PhD A : Mm - hmm . Um . Professor B : Uh . PhD A : Yeah . So we 'll see what happen with this . And {disfmarker} Yeah . So what happened since , um , {vocalsound} last week is {disfmarker} well , from OGI , these experiments on {pause} putting VAD on the baseline . And these experiments also are using , uh , some kind of noise compensation , so spectral subtraction , and putting on - line normalization , um , just after this . So I think spectral subtraction , LDA filtering , and on - line normalization , so which is similar to {vocalsound} the pro proposal - one , but with {pause} spectral subtraction in addition , and it seems that on - line normalization doesn't help further when you have spectral subtraction . PhD C : Is this related to the issue that you brought up a couple of meetings ago with the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} musical tones PhD A : I {disfmarker} PhD C : and {disfmarker} ? PhD A : I have no idea , because the issue I brought up was with a very simple spectral subtraction approach , PhD C : Mmm . PhD A : and the one that {vocalsound} they use at OGI is one from {disfmarker} from {vocalsound} the proposed {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the Aurora prop uh , proposals , which might be much better . So , yeah . I asked {vocalsound} Sunil for more information about that , but , uh , I don't know yet . Um . And what 's happened here is that we {disfmarker} so we have this kind of new , um , reference system which {vocalsound} use a nice {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a clean downsampling - upsampling , which use a new filter {vocalsound} that 's much shorter and which also cuts the frequency below sixty - four hertz , Professor B : Right . PhD A : which was not done on our first proposal . Professor B : When you say "" we have that "" , does Sunil have it now , too , PhD A : I No . Professor B : or {disfmarker} ? PhD A : No . Professor B : OK . PhD A : Because we 're still testing . So we have the result for , {vocalsound} uh , just the features Professor B : OK . PhD A : and we are currently testing with putting the neural network in the KLT . Um , it seems to improve on the well - matched case , um , {vocalsound} but it 's a little bit worse on the mismatch and highly - mismatched {disfmarker} I mean when we put the neural network . And with the current weighting I think it 's sh it will be better because the well - matched case is better . Mmm . Professor B : But how much worse {disfmarker} since the weighting might change {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} how much worse is it on the other conditions , when you say it 's a little worse ? PhD A : It 's like , uh , fff , fff {comment} {vocalsound} {pause} um , {comment} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {pause} ten percent relative . Yeah . Professor B : OK . Um . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : But it has the , uh {disfmarker} the latencies are much shorter .

I mean , this new system is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is better , Professor B : Uh - huh . PhD A : because it has {vocalsound} um , this sixty - four hertz cut - off , uh , clean {vocalsound} downsampling , and , um {disfmarker} what else ? Uh , yeah , a good VAD . We put the good VAD .

It's just saying, as a baseline, we know {disfmarker} PhD A : Mmm. Professor B : you know, we had the MFCC's before, lots of people have done voice activity detectors, PhD A : Mm - hmm. Professor B : you might as well pick some voice activity detector and make that the baseline, just like you picked some version of HTK and made that the baseline. PhD A : Yeah. Right. Professor B : And then {pause} let's try and make everything better. Um, and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features {pause} be better features for the VAD then that's {disfmarker} so be it. PhD A : Mm - hmm. Professor B : But, uh, uh, uh, at least you have a starting point that's {disfmarker} um, cuz i i some of {disfmarker} the some of the people didn't have a VAD at all, I guess. Right? And {disfmarker} and PhD A : Yeah. Professor B : then they {disfmarker} they looked pretty bad and {disfmarker} and in fact what they were doing wasn't so bad at all. PhD A : Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Professor B : But, um. PhD C : Yeah. It seems like you should try to make your baseline as good as possible. And if it turns out that {pause} you can't improve on that, well, I mean, then, you know, nobody wins and you just use MFCC. Right? Professor B : Yeah. I mean, it seems like, uh, it should include sort of the current state of the art {vocalsound} that you want {disfmarker} are trying to improve, and MFCC's, you know, or PLP or something {disfmarker} it seems like {vocalsound} reasonable baseline for the features, and anybody doing this task, {vocalsound} uh, is gonna have some sort of voice activity detection at some level, in some way. They might use the whole recognizer to do it {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} rather than {vocalsound} a separate thing, but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but they 'll have it on some level. So, um. PhD C : It seems like whatever they choose they shouldn't, {vocalsound} you know, purposefully brain - damage a part of the system to {pause} make a worse baseline, or {disfmarker} Professor B : Well, I think people just had PhD C : You know? Professor B : it wasn't that they purposely brain - damaged it. I think people hadn't really thought through {vocalsound} about the, uh {disfmarker} the VAD issue. PhD C : Mmm. PhD A : Mm - hmm. Professor B : And {disfmarker} and then when the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the proposals actually came in and half of them had V A Ds and half of them didn't, and the half that did did well and the {vocalsound} half that didn't did poorly. PhD C : Mm - hmm. Professor B : So it's {disfmarker} PhD A : Mm - hmm. Um. Professor B : Uh. PhD A : Yeah. So we 'll see what happen with this. And {disfmarker} Yeah. So what happened since, um, {vocalsound} last week is {disfmarker} well, from OGI, these experiments on {pause} putting VAD on the baseline. And these experiments also are using, uh, some kind of noise compensation, so spectral subtraction, and putting on - line normalization, um, just after this. So I think spectral subtraction, LDA filtering, and on - line normalization, so which is similar to {vocalsound} the pro proposal - one, but with {pause} spectral subtraction in addition, and it seems that on - line normalization doesn't help further when you have spectral subtraction. PhD C : Is this related to the issue that you brought up a couple of meetings ago with the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} musical tones PhD A : I {disfmarker} PhD C : and {disfmarker}? PhD A : I have no idea, because the issue I brought up was with a very simple spectral subtraction approach, PhD C : Mmm. PhD A : and the one that {vocalsound} they use at OGI is one from {disfmarker} from {vocalsound} the proposed {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the Aurora prop uh, proposals, which might be much better. So, yeah. I asked {vocalsound} Sunil for more information about that, but, uh, I don't know yet. Um. And what's happened here is that we {disfmarker} so we have this kind of new, um, reference system which {vocalsound} use a nice {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a clean downsampling - upsampling, which use a new filter {vocalsound} that's much shorter and which also cuts the frequency below sixty - four hertz, Professor B : Right. PhD A : which was not done on our first proposal. Professor B : When you say "" we have that "", does Sunil have it now, too, PhD A : I No. Professor B : or {disfmarker}? PhD A : No. Professor B : OK. PhD A : Because we're still testing. So we have the result for, {vocalsound} uh, just the features Professor B : OK. PhD A : and we are currently testing with putting the neural network in the KLT. Um, it seems to improve on the well - matched case, um, {vocalsound} but it's a little bit worse on the mismatch and highly - mismatched {disfmarker} I mean when we put the neural network. And with the current weighting I think it's sh it will be better because the well - matched case is better. Mmm. Professor B : But how much worse {disfmarker} since the weighting might change {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} how much worse is it on the other conditions, when you say it's a little worse? PhD A : It's like, uh, fff, fff {comment} {vocalsound} {pause} um, {comment} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {pause} ten percent relative. Yeah. Professor B : OK. Um. PhD A : Mm - hmm. Professor B : But it has the, uh {disfmarker} the latencies are much shorter. That's {disfmarker} PhD A : Uh - y w when I say it's worse, it's not {disfmarker} it's when I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} uh, compare proposal - two to proposal - one, so, r uh, y putting neural network {vocalsound} compared to n not having any neural network. I mean, this new system is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is better, Professor B : Uh - huh. PhD A : because it has {vocalsound} um, this sixty - four hertz cut - off, uh, clean {vocalsound} downsampling, and, um {disfmarker} what else? Uh, yeah, a good VAD. We put the good VAD. So. Yeah, I don't know. I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} j uh, uh {disfmarker} pr Professor B : But the latencies {disfmarker} but you've got the latency shorter now. PhD A : Latency is short {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} Yeah. Professor B : Yeah. PhD F : Isn't it PhD A : And so Professor B : So it's better than the system that we had before. PhD A : Yeah. Mainly because {pause} {vocalsound} of {pause} the sixty - four hertz and the good VAD. Professor B : OK. Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"

472,"Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you very much. The next questions, then, are from Dawn Bowden on safeguarding and child protection. Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Deputy Minister, because one of the questions I was going to ask was around some of the work that you've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection, and I think you've covered that. But what I'm particularly keen to find out is how you're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round. I know the health Minister raised this as a concern in Plenary only recently, and it's really how we are monitoring it, what concerns have been identified, and how we're going to start to tackle some of those. Julie Morgan AM : Yes. Thank you very much, Dawn, for that question. Obviously, it is difficult to monitor if there's not easy access to the children that we're referring to, and that's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings. And there's been a lot of encouragement for that happen. The Minister, the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities, asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school. In fact, we've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings, and that's the highest number that we've had at all since the opening of the scheme. But it's still only a tiny drop in the ocean. But it's very good, and it is progress that the numbers attending are now going up. But, of course, there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing. There has been a drop in safeguarding referrals to social services. Those numbers are now beginning to go up, but there certainly was a significant drop, which is a great deal of concern. One local authority, in fact, reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year. So, I issued a written statement on 1 May, setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children, young people and safeguarding work stream, and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are. Because, obviously, we are dependent on the public authorities—you know, schools and health services—to report any concerns, and at the moment, obviously, they're not there to report them. So, we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other, and I was very interested in what Siân Gwenllian told me about what was being done in Anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen, and to raise their concerns, because, obviously, safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community. But I think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are, in fact, keeping close touch, as far as they possibly can, with all the children that are vulnerable. For those where it is very critical, face-to-face contact is still taking place, and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families. So, it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it, but I think as much as possible is being done. Lynne Neagle AM : Jean, you wanted to come in on that. Professor Jean White : Just to add to what the Deputy Minister was saying, the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back. It has consolidated some of the ways that it does the Healthy Child Wales Programme, but, for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable, all the normal contacts have been maintained, so they're not unseen to the normal health visiting service. That covers both Flying Start and general health visiting areas. Thank you. Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you, Jean, for that, and, Deputy Minister, would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current Welsh Government definition and guidance around vulnerable children, in terms of who we identify as vulnerable? Because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable. So,it's just looking at the current guidance that we have. Do you think that needs revisiting at all? Julie Morgan AM : The definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs, and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised. But we have now looked at this again, and we've set out an expanded definition, and we intend to publish that this week. This does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services. Because, obviously, the children that we know about, we know about, but there are those other children who may be on the edge of care—the children that we've been trying very hard, as part of our policies in the Welsh Government, to keep with their families, with a lot of support. Those are the ones that we also want to support. So, we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility, and that will be published this week. Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you. Thank you, Chair. Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you. We're going to move on now, then, to talk about looked-after children and children on the edge of care, with questions from Janet Finch-Saunders. Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you, Chair. Can you set out the impact the coronavirus emergency has had on the care system, including edge-of-care services, and where have there been areas of concern? Julie Morgan AM : Well, local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the COVID emergency, so a red-amber-green rating risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services. This is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so every case that is known is being RAG rated and services are being linked to that. Also, there is very close contact between Welsh Government officials and the local authorities. There are weekly meetings between officials and the heads of the children's services. I can't speak too highly, really, about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on. We've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children, and the number of placement breaks are minimal. The other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus, and, obviously, that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce. So, there's very close contact. The children are all being monitored individually, and I think in the circumstances we're all doing what we possibly can. I know that Albert Heaney is able, probably, to respond in more detail to the contacts, if you'd like to have that. Lynne Neagle AM : I think we'll move on to the next section. Can I remind everyone again: sharp focused questions and concise answers? Janet. Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thanks. How is Welsh Government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks? Julie Morgan AM : It is normal practice to ensure that children and families do have appropriate access to technology to keep in touch with social workers, so that is part of our normal practice. We're very keen as a Welsh Government that no children are left behind in their education during this period. So, last month, as you will know, the Minister for Education announced £3 million of funding to help digitally excluded learners so that they've got access to the internet, so that they can fully participate in online learning. So, we do normally ensure that they've got digital contact for social workers. Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you. Can you set out the picture regarding children's residential care? What are the challenges these care settings are facing, and have any children's homes closed? Julie Morgan AM : Residential children's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues, and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened. So, I'm very pleased to report that. We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported, and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings, and that is going on, although it may be by technology rather than face to face. We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge, and I think it’s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult. So, there have been a few issues related to that, but, where that has happened, local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis, and really there are not any major issues. In terms of residential care, Hillside is functioning well—no reporting issues. The staffing levels are normal. There are fewer children and young people there, so, in fact, there's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children, and I think we've had very good reports about how that has happened. So, I am absolutely reassured by our officials here that everything is as well as it could be. I also meet with the children's commissioner once a week, who is an independent source, and she said when I met her last week, 'Well, as far as we know, it's all good news'. So, I don't think we have any concerns at the moment about the residential care. Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Okay. Moving on to foster care, how is Welsh Government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the Association of Fostering and Adoption Cymru and its fostering guidelines? Julie Morgan AM : We have worked with the fostering organisations. We have had close communications with them, and we've supported AFA Cymru to develop guidance for foster carers, and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector. We're working with the third sector. I think I mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and, of course, care leavers. The Fostering Network has extended its helpline hours, and, of course, Voices from Care—I mentioned them before—have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers. I've been reassured, as well, from Voices from Care that the young people appear to be more stable now—that they have contact with. But that's online help for them. So, we have had quite a lot of contact with the fostering services. Janet Finch-Saunders AM : So, the final point on that, then: the Fostering Network and others, as you know, have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer, with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses. What is your position on this, please? Julie Morgan AM : Well, we haven't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers, but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people, I believe, have increased the amount of money that they are paying. They've also given support for various activities and things—have helped sometimes, I think, with broadband access and that sort of issue. And, obviously, foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency. Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you. Lynne Neagle AM : Okay. Thank you. Albert, I just wanted to check there wasn't anything you wanted to add, please. Albert Heaney : Thank you very much, Chair. I think the only thing to add was relating to monitoring. The Minister has indicated that we are speaking weekly with heads of children's services, and we do now have a data collection that's been implemented to capture the critical data in relation to the children's services. So, that will assist us in our monitoring arrangements going forward. Thank you, Chair.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

So, we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other, and I was very interested in what Siân Gwenllian told me about what was being done in Anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen, and to raise their concerns, because, obviously, safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community. But I think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are, in fact, keeping close touch, as far as they possibly can, with all the children that are vulnerable. For those where it is very critical, face-to-face contact is still taking place, and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families. So, it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it, but I think as much as possible is being done. Lynne Neagle AM : Jean, you wanted to come in on that. Professor Jean White : Just to add to what the Deputy Minister was saying, the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back. It has consolidated some of the ways that it does the Healthy Child Wales Programme, but, for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable, all the normal contacts have been maintained, so they're not unseen to the normal health visiting service. That covers both Flying Start and general health visiting areas. Thank you. Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you, Jean, for that, and, Deputy Minister, would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current Welsh Government definition and guidance around vulnerable children, in terms of who we identify as vulnerable? Because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable. So,it's just looking at the current guidance that we have. Do you think that needs revisiting at all? Julie Morgan AM : The definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs, and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised. But we have now looked at this again, and we've set out an expanded definition, and we intend to publish that this week. This does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services. Because, obviously, the children that we know about, we know about, but there are those other children who may be on the edge of care—the children that we've been trying very hard, as part of our policies in the Welsh Government, to keep with their families, with a lot of support. Those are the ones that we also want to support. So, we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility, and that will be published this week. Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you. Thank you, Chair. Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you. We're going to move on now, then, to talk about looked-after children and children on the edge of care, with questions from Janet Finch-Saunders. Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you, Chair. Can you set out the impact the coronavirus emergency has had on the care system, including edge-of-care services, and where have there been areas of concern? Julie Morgan AM : Well, local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the COVID emergency, so a red-amber-green rating risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services. This is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so every case that is known is being RAG rated and services are being linked to that. Also, there is very close contact between Welsh Government officials and the local authorities. There are weekly meetings between officials and the heads of the children's services. I can't speak too highly, really, about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on. We've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children, and the number of placement breaks are minimal. The other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus, and, obviously, that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce. So, there's very close contact. The children are all being monitored individually, and I think in the circumstances we're all doing what we possibly can. I know that Albert Heaney is able, probably, to respond in more detail to the contacts, if you'd like to have that. Lynne Neagle AM : I think we'll move on to the next section. Can I remind everyone again: sharp focused questions and concise answers? Janet. Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thanks. How is Welsh Government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks? Julie Morgan AM : It is normal practice to ensure that children and families do have appropriate access to technology to keep in touch with social workers, so that is part of our normal practice. We're very keen as a Welsh Government that no children are left behind in their education during this period. So, last month, as you will know, the Minister for Education announced £3 million of funding to help digitally excluded learners so that they've got access to the internet, so that they can fully participate in online learning. So, we do normally ensure that they've got digital contact for social workers. Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you. Can you set out the picture regarding children's residential care? What are the challenges these care settings are facing, and have any children's homes closed? Julie Morgan AM : Residential children's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues, and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened. So, I'm very pleased to report that. We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported, and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings, and that is going on, although it may be by technology rather than face to face. We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge, and I think it’s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult. So, there have been a few issues related to that, but, where that has happened, local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis, and really there are not any major issues. In terms of residential care, Hillside is functioning well—no reporting issues. The staffing levels are normal. There are fewer children and young people there, so, in fact, there's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children, and I think we've had very good reports about how that has happened. So, I am absolutely reassured by our officials here that everything is as well as it could be. I also meet with the children's commissioner once a week, who is an independent source, and she said when I met her last week, 'Well, as far as we know, it's all good news'. So, I don't think we have any concerns at the moment about the residential care. Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Okay. Moving on to foster care, how is Welsh Government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the Association of Fostering and Adoption Cymru and its fostering guidelines? Julie Morgan AM : We have worked with the fostering organisations. We have had close communications with them, and we've supported AFA Cymru to develop guidance for foster carers, and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector. We're working with the third sector. I think I mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and, of course, care leavers. The Fostering Network has extended its helpline hours, and, of course, Voices from Care—I mentioned them before—have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers. I've been reassured, as well, from Voices from Care that the young people appear to be more stable now—that they have contact with. But that's online help for them. So, we have had quite a lot of contact with the fostering services. Janet Finch-Saunders AM : So, the final point on that, then: the Fostering Network and others, as you know, have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer, with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses. What is your position on this, please? Julie Morgan AM : Well, we haven't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers, but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people, I believe, have increased the amount of money that they are paying. They've also given support for various activities and things—have helped sometimes, I think, with broadband access and that sort of issue. And, obviously, foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency. Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you. Lynne Neagle AM : Okay. Thank you. Albert, I just wanted to check there wasn't anything you wanted to add, please. Albert Heaney : Thank you very much, Chair. I think the only thing to add was relating to monitoring. The Minister has indicated that we are speaking weekly with heads of children's services, and we do now have a data collection that's been implemented to capture the critical data in relation to the children's services. So, that will assist us in our monitoring arrangements going forward. Thank you, Chair. Questions: |eot_id|>assistant you, Chair, and thank you, Deputy Minister, because one of the questions I was going to ask was around some of the work that you've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection, and I think you've covered that. But what I'm particularly keen to find out is how you're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection"
489,"Project Manager : Alright ? Alright . Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . Um {vocalsound} the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . Um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn . Um and people lose them . And {vocalsound} We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , um {vocalsound} that we're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . That {disfmarker} um {vocalsound} we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . So again um , I'll {disfmarker} we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one . And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . And uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . Um {vocalsound} now the the the internal chip um {disfmarker} and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : and given that {vocalsound} th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? Uh I mean I'm I'm I'm n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : But uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise . And then the uh , you know , the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendra's field and uh User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today . Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we p um {vocalsound} go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Uh so , if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . Um {disfmarker} Project Manager : Kate . Oh I'm sorry , oh sorry . Industrial Designer : Um p there we go . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} 'Kay , I'll just be talking about the components design . And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ . Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at {disfmarker} uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um . {vocalsound} Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip {disfmarker} the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh {disfmarker} which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and sort of seen by the T_V_ and which uh changes the channels . {vocalsound} Um . Oh . {vocalsound} Uh cool . {vocalsound} Uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . Um however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost . That's something we should think about . Also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea . {vocalsound} Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . Um , however that's gonna cost more , but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be {disfmarker} allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay , Industrial Designer : so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . {vocalsound} And that pretty much sums it up . Project Manager : so how um {disfmarker} sorry , can you uh just put that one back up again , please ? Um . Industrial Designer : Mm . Oh yep , sorry . {vocalsound} Yep . Project Manager : Uh d d d {vocalsound} okay , I mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . Do we do we know uh by how much ? Industrial Designer : Mm . {vocalsound} Um I don't actually have any price information , no . {vocalsound} Project Manager : And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip . Industrial Designer : Um it {disfmarker} a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . Oh w yeah , we did {disfmarker} the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , Project Manager : Right , Industrial Designer : it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form , Project Manager : okay . Industrial Designer : uh so it would uh {disfmarker} it's hard to predict the time . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Right , I think we need to make a a decision here . Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . Um uh now before we go round everybody else , does anybody um h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ? User Interface : I {disfmarker} I just have a question about that . Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites um Industrial Designer : W just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . User Interface : and that w Industrial Designer : Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world {disfmarker} the the sky is your limit , User Interface : Okay . Then it doesn't matter . Okay . Industrial Designer : but to actually {disfmarker} the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : Cause uh I {vocalsound} must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . So uh um I mean User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : I d d for slightly different {disfmarker} well no , I mean , it's if you you {disfmarker} speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so uh bu I mean the this this information is from {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} this is the internal company information , is it ? Industrial Designer : Uh bits of it , yeah . Project Manager : So uh {disfmarker} User Interface : Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , Industrial Designer : Yes , as well . Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : you know , hundred and fifty pounds or something . As opposed to the twenty Euros , twenty five Euros . Project Manager : Yeah , mm true , again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : uh decide . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : {vocalsound} Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Yeah , that's that's right . It's like {disfmarker} it's it's {disfmarker} you can't {disfmarker} 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is . User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . Project Manager : But we don't know . Um . {vocalsound} I mean uh I su i I mean if {disfmarker} given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before , um th th the double risk , uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Um . Thoughts ? User Interface : Well , another thought I {disfmarker} Marketing : Would {disfmarker} User Interface : oh , sorry , go ahead . Marketing : Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um {disfmarker} maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . Project Manager : {vocalsound} I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ? Industrial Designer : Uh it's fundament well I mean I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning , so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so I think you have to {disfmarker} Project Manager : I mean I think we {disfmarker} {gap} User Interface : Oh yeah . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Hm . User Interface : {gap} Okay . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing . Project Manager : Yeah , I I I I I think that's uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : And we've been talking about it the whole time . Project Manager : Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm , mm . User Interface : Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . Project Manager : Mm , right , okay . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Uh yeah , {gap} it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . Project Manager : {gap} User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : From uh my presentation show , so . Project Manager : Yeah , it should be {disfmarker} Marketing : Uh technologically innovative . Project Manager : Right , okay , so . Industrial Designer : No , Project Manager : Fine . Okay . Industrial Designer : that sounds good . Mm . Project Manager : I it will have voice recognition um uh Industrial Designer : Mm . Cool . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Project Manager : second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , {vocalsound} volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons ? User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , I I would say we do , yeah . User Interface : I think so . Project Manager : Right . Okay . Sorry , d did you want to say anything ? No ? Industrial Designer : Uh nope , Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : that was it , that was it .","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

Project Manager : I d d for slightly different {disfmarker} well no, I mean, it's if you you {disfmarker} speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you, so uh bu I mean the this this information is from {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} this is the internal company information, is it? Industrial Designer : Uh bits of it, yeah. Project Manager : So uh {disfmarker} User Interface : Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive, Industrial Designer : Yes, as well. Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : you know, hundred and fifty pounds or something. As opposed to the twenty Euros, twenty five Euros. Project Manager : Yeah, mm true, again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : uh decide. User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them, not just that, so. Industrial Designer : Mm. Project Manager : Yeah, that's that's right. It's like {disfmarker} it's it's {disfmarker} you can't {disfmarker} 'cause mobile phones are expensive, you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is. User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah. Project Manager : But we don't know. Um. {vocalsound} I mean uh I su i I mean if {disfmarker} given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before, um th th the double risk, uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons, since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work. Um. Thoughts? User Interface : Well, another thought I {disfmarker} Marketing : Would {disfmarker} User Interface : oh, sorry, go ahead. Marketing : Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um {disfmarker} maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost. Project Manager : {vocalsound} I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project? Industrial Designer : Uh it's fundament well I mean I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning, so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental, but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that, so I think you have to {disfmarker} Project Manager : I mean I think we {disfmarker} {gap} User Interface : Oh yeah. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Mm. Industrial Designer : Hm. User Interface : {gap} Okay. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : Well, I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it, then maybe we should have it for the whole thing. Project Manager : Yeah, I I I I I think that's uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Mm. User Interface : And we've been talking about it the whole time. Project Manager : Yeah, yeah. Industrial Designer : Mm, mm. User Interface : Anyway, I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it. Project Manager : Mm, right, okay. Industrial Designer : Mm. Marketing : Uh yeah, {gap} it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative. Project Manager : {gap} User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : From uh my presentation show, so. Project Manager : Yeah, it should be {disfmarker} Marketing : Uh technologically innovative. Project Manager : Right, okay, so. Industrial Designer : No, Project Manager : Fine. Okay. Industrial Designer : that sounds good. Mm. Project Manager : I it will have voice recognition um uh Industrial Designer : Mm. Cool. User Interface : Okay. Project Manager : if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Project Manager : second question, do we need the five buttons for channel change, up down, {vocalsound} volume up down and on off, just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons? User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Yeah, I I would say we do, yeah. User Interface : I think so. Project Manager : Right. Okay. Sorry, d did you want to say anything? No? Industrial Designer : Uh nope, Project Manager : Okay. Industrial Designer : that was it, that was it. Questions: |eot_id|>assistant to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves? Uh I mean I'm I'm not an expert on these things, but presumably, there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify."

544,"John Griffiths AM : We certainly do not expect you to enter the political fray in any way. Dr David Blaney : Thank you. But even in terms of your assessment of whether this is going to be a good thing or a bad thing, a good impact or a bad impact, some of that inevitably in the end becomes a matter of your politics on it, so we will be as careful as we can be on that. In terms of the impact of Brexit on higher education, clearly, the significance here is about the contribution that higher education can make to Wales. So, we fund provision; we don't fund providers, technically, although obviously there's not much provision without providers. So, we are interested in the sustainability of higher education providers, but fundamentally the issue is: what does the HE system in Wales do for Wales, and what impact might Brexit have on the capacity of the system to continue to deliver for Wales? So, we know that universities make annually about £5 billion of impact; 50,000 jobs. Of course, in Wales, all of that economic impact is really very significant, and uncertainty about the relationships and the arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment. That has an impact in a number of ways. We can identify at the moment the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU, so EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and so on, from the EU. We can identify some of that, but, actually, what happens in the future is much harder to be clear about. We are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and I'll ask Bethan to share some details on that in a moment. We're also beginning to pick up, only anecdotally, some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the UK sector, and the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities. And that, I think, just reflects the extent to which EU partners consider that British partners might be a stable partner as we go through this transition period. We don't have data on that—that's anecdotal—but there are signs that some of those relationships are beginning to become a little bit more difficult. In terms of the financial impact of that, clearly, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of the money—we're almost immediately straight into politics if you're not careful—but some of the money will be available back to the UK, and the extent to which Wales benefits or not from that returned money is a function of the political relationship between the Welsh Government and Her Majesty's Government. It's not necessarily the case that Wales will always lose out in that relationship, but that will become a matter of politics. There's a broader dimension, which is about the economic impact of Brexit on the UK economy and how much tax revenue there is and all of that. I think it's very hard for us to be definitive about how that's going to play out. I think that depends on the deal and how it all unfolds over the next several years. But we can certainly anticipate some turbulence and exactly how that plays for institutions remains to be seen. We can touch later on on the extent to which they are sighted on this and preparing for it. So, in terms of recruitment, Bethan. Bethan Owen : This is based on the UCAS applications and the report that was published at the end of June, 30 June. The European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales have decreased by 8 per cent, which contrasts with a 2 per cent increase for English institutions, and non-EU—so international students, not from Europe—have also decreased by 9 per cent to Welsh institutions, again contrasting with a 7 per cent increase in England. So, those are the signs of changes.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

PhD F : Yeah that would be good. I mean Andreas and I have various talks in the halls PhD D : Mm - hmm. PhD F : and there's lots of things, you know, details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in and I 'd {disfmarker} you know, where do we go from here kind of things and {disfmarker} So, it would be good. Professor B : Yeah, and you're {disfmarker} you're attending {pause} the uh {disfmarker} the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have {disfmarker} you have probably one of the best {disfmarker} you and I, I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two. Grad A : Bridge. PhD D : Mm - hmm. Professor B : We are doing recognition in both of them. So. PhD F : Mm - hmm. PhD D : Right. Professor B : Uh. Grad A : OK? PhD D : So um. So {disfmarker} so we could talk a little bit about that now if {disfmarker} if there's some time. Grad A : No, no that would be for next week. PhD D : Um I jus So the latest result was that um um yot I tested the uh {disfmarker} the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for {disfmarker} for this year's Hub - five test set.

555,"The Chair : Mr.Therrien, you now have the floor. Mr. Alain Therrien (La Prairie, BQ) : Mr.Chair, during the pandemic, the government has given money to companies that don't pay a cent in tax because they use tax havens. We told the government that it didn't make sense. The government's response was that it is no big deal. During the pandemic, the government gave money to Air Canada, but Air Canada never reimbursed customers who did not get the services they paid for. We told the government that it did not make sense. The government's response was that it was no big deal. During the pandemic, the Liberal Party used the emergency wage subsidy to fund partisan activities. We told them that it did not make sense. The government responded that it was no big deal. Is the moral of the story that the government thinks that dipping into the pockets of taxpayers to spend money carelessly is no big deal? Hon. Diane Lebouthillier (Minister of National Revenue) : Mr.Chair, the fight against tax evasion is a priority for our government. We will continue to target companies that use tax evasion schemes. Let me be clear: in everything we do, we will target companies and not innocent workers. Employees are employees, no matter who they work for. Mr. Alain Therrien : Mr.Chair, when I see that it's the Minister of National Revenue answering me, I don't feel like buying a lottery ticket. The Liberal Party used two airplanes in its last election campaign, which seems to indicate that it isn't short of money. However, the Liberals used the emergency wage subsidy. Why? Is it because they want taxpayers to fund a third airplane? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair, we think it's very important to protect employees across the country and in every economic sector that's experiencing a significant drop in income. That's the approach we've taken to protect people and to ensure that there will be jobs in the future. We will continue this approach. Mr. Alain Therrien : It's especially important to protect the employees who work for the Liberals to ensure their re-election, yet the Liberal Party has raised more than $7million since the last election. Is the party in jeopardy? Can it go bankrupt? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair, as I said, our approach is to protect employees. We think that this principle is very important and that this approach must be maintained in order to have a better job market in the future. Mr. Alain Therrien : Mr.Chair, we still don't know exactly how much money the Liberals took from the cookie jar. We think they may have taken as much as $1million. How many SMEs could have been saved with the $1million that the Liberals took out of the jar and took away from SMEs? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair, we appreciate the question. We are protecting hundreds of thousands of SMEs through the emergency wage subsidy, the Canada emergency response benefit and all our programs. We will continue this approach to help SMEs and their employees. Mr. Alain Therrien : Mr.Chair, I will propose a choice of answers, or I won't get any. When did the government decide to use the emergency wage subsidy? Now here are three possible answers. The first possible answer is that when the Liberals brought in the emergency wage subsidy, they set parameters allowing them to use it. The second is that when the Liberals saw the Conservative Partywhich is as rich as they are, but also sanctimonious and self-righteoustake advantage of the subsidy, they thought they could do it too. The third possible answer is that the Liberals hadn't planned to use the subsidy, but they pounced on the cookie jar when they saw it, because that's what they do. Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair, we continue to think it is very important to protect employees in every sector of the economy and across Canada. That's our approach, and I believe it's the right one to protect and preserve jobs across the country during a pandemic. The Chair : We are now going to suspend the proceedings for a few seconds to allow the employees who provide support for the meeting to replace each other safely. The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)) : We will now resume the discussion.  We'll continue with Ms. Khalid, the honourable member for MississaugaErin Mills.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Okay . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : The the lemon . Well what are the options ? User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} User Interface : But we don't want it to be {disfmarker} Yeah . Um the child-friendly , yeah . Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . I like I like the colourful buttons as well . User Interface : I think that's a good idea to go for . Yeah . And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . Um . Project Manager : Yeah . I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use . User Interface : S yeah . So they'd be able to use that um , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Um so there you go . Project Manager : And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Oh . User Interface : So that's um the user interface Project Manager : 'Kay . User Interface : design . Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} Industrial Designer : Okay . User Interface : So okay , I'll take this out now then . Industrial Designer : Um so Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : There you go . Industrial Designer : I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah , looks like it . Industrial Designer : and I'll I'll give you the uh , {vocalsound} I guess , technical considerations for those . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Uh {vocalsound} User Interface : {gap} Industrial Designer : And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it {vocalsound} . Project Manager : Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing . {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Right . So , the way I'm gonna do this {vocalsound} is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : and then we'll throw in our new innovations um {vocalsound} and keep it all within budget . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Magic man . Industrial Designer : So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . Um this is what they sent me . 'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : um {vocalsound} and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , and ch Project Manager : So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? Industrial Designer : Right , it's very {disfmarker} they're very cheap remote . This remote costs nothing , you know . Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . Project Manager : Right . Industrial Designer : Oh here it is . {vocalsound} Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : Okay . So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? Industrial Designer : R Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . Project Manager : They gotta be {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Almost a key-ring . {gap} Industrial Designer : Right . So this is what we need to have for certain . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay . Industrial Designer : Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved . So lots of choices , User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : 'Kay . Industrial Designer : what do we think ? Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . Project Manager : Well . User Interface : Mm . I'm not sure about the sponge . Industrial Designer : Organic sponge . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . Industrial Designer : Uh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure . Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Yeah . And that would k also give it kinda durability User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : and User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Um . Project Manager : and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . Industrial Designer : Yeah so {disfmarker} Project Manager : Um {vocalsound} so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic {disfmarker} initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? Industrial Designer : Okay so , here are a a plastic , uh latex {disfmarker} User Interface : I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , Project Manager : Oh right , okay . User Interface : you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Oh right . Project Manager : I don't know what that stuff is . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : So something with give to it . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . And User Interface : And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . Industrial Designer : and the colour is yellow , right ? User Interface : Yeah , Project Manager : Or at least incorporating , yeah . {vocalsound} User Interface : y {vocalsound} yellow incorporated , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yellow {vocalsound} , okay . Um . Project Manager : I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh {disfmarker} I don't know what other standard silver kind of {disfmarker} User Interface : I think {disfmarker} Project Manager : Other parts or uh {disfmarker} User Interface : Mm . Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Mm' kay . User Interface : or i if we're having buttons actually , Industrial Designer : So yellow for the body , User Interface : I don Project Manager : Um . Industrial Designer : and then what colour for the buttons ? Project Manager : Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So multi-coloured buttons . User Interface : You do have ones like um play {vocalsound} could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . Industrial Designer : {gap} Project Manager : Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . User Interface : {vocalsound} Makes it easy to use . Yeah , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay . Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . I mean if we are gonna make it a novel {disfmarker} I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , Industrial Designer : Okay . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Project Manager : a bit comfier , you know . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go {disfmarker} Um how exactly ? Maybe double {disfmarker} User Interface : Like uh {vocalsound} an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , Project Manager : Yeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be {disfmarker} that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . User Interface : or just like a {disfmarker} It's not {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : What about a banana ? User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} We could make novelty remote controls . Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , Project Manager : Well , yeah , I mean like {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : 'cause it's yellow fruit , User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : right ? Project Manager : Yeah , yeah . Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah . {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah . But then how would you point it ? Marketing : Ah Industrial Designer : {gap} Marketing : yeah . Mm-hmm . User Interface : How would you point it ? Industrial Designer : Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . User Interface : What {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah , I appreciate this idea , Project Manager : They only cost pennies . User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : because then this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this will help us in our advertisement also Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . That what our data shows that , so this w this w User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Huh ? User Interface : {gap} y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Um . Industrial Designer : So a spongy banana re {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} I mean that that th {vocalsound} User Interface : Rubber banana . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : does User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay . Project Manager : it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . Industrial Designer : Okay , okay . User Interface : I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . And what else did you say about fashions ? What was trendy ? Marketing : Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , Project Manager : {vocalsound} S Industrial Designer : See {disfmarker} Marketing : like people uh now {disfmarker} Project Manager : And sponginess . Industrial Designer : So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable User Interface : And spongy , yeah . Marketing : Spongy . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : like so it would have a stem perhaps User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and a User Interface : Maybe , yeah . Industrial Designer : maybe a {disfmarker} it'd be s axially symmetric . Project Manager : Huh . User Interface : Like what's what's that {vocalsound} , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like {disfmarker} looks like a little snowman kind of thing . I don't know the name of that . Industrial Designer : So it'd look like this kinda . User Interface : Yeah , that's what I was thinking . Industrial Designer : Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? Project Manager : Uh . User Interface : Yeah , maybe that's what they are . Project Manager : {gap} User Interface : 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit Industrial Designer : Yeah , User Interface : and {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah , why the hell not . {vocalsound} Let's {vocalsound} that'll make us fifty million Euros . User Interface : I don't know . What do you guy {disfmarker} What do you think ? Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Um . Well , I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : yeah ? User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , then only we can relate it with something . Project Manager : Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . Exactly . Industrial Designer : Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . Marketing : {vocalsound} Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . User Interface : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : There's a good man . There's a good idea . User Interface : Okay . Industrial Designer : Okay um , I guess , since you're the marketing guy . Marketing : Yeah , sure . I will be happy to do that . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : We'll uh {disfmarker} Okay , we could do that . Um . User Interface : Okay . And buttons would , did we say ? Uh different shapes of buttons ? Industrial Designer : {gap} Project Manager : Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Okay , so Project Manager : They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um Industrial Designer : so buttons . Project Manager : things that are always used . Industrial Designer : Okay , just like that . User Interface : {gap} {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} That's cool . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : {vocalsound} I like it . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : Um . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : With the scroll-wheel or no ? User Interface : Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? {vocalsound} Project Manager : Uh speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably . Industrial Designer : Okay uh I could put the microphone here . {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay there's the microphone . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Where should I put the microphone ? Project Manager : I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? User Interface : Yeah , I'm not sure . Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Glad , we're not doing this for real . User Interface : Um yeah , I can {disfmarker} no I'm not sure . Industrial Designer : Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? User Interface : I couldn Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is {gap} the microphone {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Okay . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or {disfmarker} Project Manager : I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's {disfmarker} Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : 'Kay there's the mic . Project Manager : So it can be sort of held and w {gap} {vocalsound} User Interface : That's cool . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {disfmarker} We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . Industrial Designer : Um n well we can {disfmarker} Whoops . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Oops . {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Um . Project Manager : Um . User Interface : So let's not use the whiteboard any more . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Um . Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Upsidaisy . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Oops , sorry . Okay . User Interface : And uh so what else was there ? Um the {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? Project Manager : {vocalsound} I s I still like it . User Interface : Are we just gonna leave that ? Project Manager : Um but that's me . {vocalsound} User Interface : You still like it . 'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . User Interface : 'Cause um it could {disfmarker} Yeah . Project Manager : Um don't wanna sort of overkill . User Interface : Especially with yellow {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Mm . I dunno . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : 'Cause I mean like uh if we {disfmarker} I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? Industrial Designer : {gap} {gap} {vocalsound} They can work from a {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah , you know , and then you just tal Industrial Designer : You don't have to hold it . Project Manager : I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} User Interface : Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , Project Manager : {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : you know they have uh fruits all round them . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Make them make them think of fruit , yeah . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Now just make sure they don't eat the remote . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : I mean uh {vocalsound} some uh I User Interface : Yeah , do we need buttons ? Project Manager : l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : Then it's just apple so sort of {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Uh , yellow apples though {disfmarker} Hmm . {vocalsound} User Interface : I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite {disfmarker} got a quite steady base . Industrial Designer : {gap} Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , yeah , that's good . Industrial Designer : Okay . But yeah {disfmarker} Project Manager : Groovy . User Interface : Um Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . Project Manager : Yeah , {gap} . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . User Interface : {gap} Industrial Designer : It can sit at a distance and pick it up still . Project Manager : Yeah . So {vocalsound} I mean like you could actually {disfmarker} User Interface : Okay . Marketing : Or we can {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah , gives you the options . Marketing : we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : So a selection of casings . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : it will look l {vocalsound} Uh yeah . In that w Project Manager : It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , Marketing : S s sorry ? User Interface : didn't you ? You said about disposable earli people want disposable things Marketing : Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , Project Manager : {gap} User Interface : so we could do that , like have a choice . Yeah . Marketing : okay ? If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . Project Manager : Like like mobiles , yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put {disfmarker} we will put apple shape casing on that . It will give apple shape look . So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : {gap} User Interface : Okay . Marketing : without {disfmarker} uh yeah . User Interface : We still need the buttons in the same places thought , Marketing : Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . User Interface : don't we ? Project Manager : You can standardise those , I mean . User Interface : {gap} Marketing : Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , User Interface : Oh , that's the other side . Oh , okay . Marketing : so half of that will be look the {disfmarker} User Interface : Oh , half a fruit . Oh , okay , okay . Marketing : Yeah , not not the upper side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of {disfmarker} from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . User Interface : Okay , okay . Marketing : So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah . Marketing : And {disfmarker} Project Manager : I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : 'cause when {disfmarker} if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . It doesn't really {disfmarker} User Interface : Mm mm . Project Manager : You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . Project Manager : unless you have sort of {disfmarker} you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the {disfmarker} User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Maybe . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {gap} Okay , um so {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . Industrial Designer : Yeah , Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : s I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and the colours we got down , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Well , um because {disfmarker} Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because {vocalsound} what {disfmarker} Project Manager : Okay , so we stick with what we've got there . User Interface : Yeah , w I think wh wha would {disfmarker} we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a {disfmarker} too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , Project Manager : Mm 'kay . User Interface : because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} User Interface : I mean we could make it nice pale yellow . Project Manager : Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . {vocalsound} User Interface : Okay . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different User Interface : Okay . Yeah . Project Manager : colour , but have {disfmarker} User Interface : Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . Project Manager : kinda going round , yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Um I mean e even if {disfmarker} User Interface : Because {disfmarker} Project Manager : I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : W sort of {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Great . {vocalsound} Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that . We can use a hand-dynamo . Um I don't know what that means , we crank it ? {vocalsound} Project Manager : Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda {vocalsound} powers it . Industrial Designer : Right , it's like those watches that you c Project Manager : Uh yeah . Industrial Designer : So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . User Interface : Oh , a d a dynamo ? Marketing : Yeah , {gap} . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah , I like that , yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : {gap} User Interface : Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah that's quite cool . Industrial Designer : Okay . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . {vocalsound} Marketing : But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Project Manager : Okay . You shake it and scream at it . Marketing : But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah , it is , yeah . Marketing : Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat Project Manager : It does leave them with an obligation to {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah , to mo Yeah . Project Manager : Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . Marketing : Yeah , Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : because most of the people {disfmarker} Project Manager : Then if it's just sitting on the {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then {disfmarker} Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Okay , okay . Industrial Designer : Okay . User Interface : That's true . Project Manager : Right um what are the other options ? Industrial Designer : Uh there's solar power . Um . Marketing : Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : and the days when there is no sola sunlight {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Project Manager : I'm I'm with uh Raj on that , Industrial Designer : Okay , so probably just {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : I think , you know , Marketing : What we w Project Manager : I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . User Interface : {gap} Marketing : yeah . I think we should {disfmarker} a rechargeable {vocalsound} battery will be a good idea . User Interface : But w {vocalsound} like just normal light ? Project Manager : Oh that's true . Marketing : They can they can recharge it . Project Manager : I mean I w I w uh User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : that idea that I thought {vocalsound} um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : is having a , User Interface : And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? Project Manager : yeah , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as {disfmarker} uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : 'Kay . User Interface : Like like a hand {disfmarker} like one of those portable phones kind of thing . Marketing : Yeah , that's {disfmarker} Yeah , exactly . Project Manager : Yeah that kind of thing . Industrial Designer : Okay . So uh a rechargeable battery {gap} . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Okay . Um the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already . Project Manager : Rechargeable . User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Um . Project Manager : {gap} . What's chip on print ? What's {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Hmm ? Project Manager : Sorry , never mind . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Uh th the uh the electronics um , basically the more features we add um {disfmarker} Oops , this one . So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in ,","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

Document: Industrial Designer : So which vegetable? {vocalsound} Project Manager : Well I mean we could make a {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah, I know, carrot {vocalsound}. Project Manager : Yeah. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Okay. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Well, si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours, I think your lemon wasn't that far s {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : The the lemon. Well what are the options? User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : And if it doesn't work you know, we've just made a lemon. {vocalsound} {vocalsound} User Interface : But we don't want it to be {disfmarker} Yeah. Um the child-friendly, yeah. Easy to use, it seems quite easy to use. I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff. Project Manager : Mm-hmm. I like I like the colourful buttons as well. User Interface : I think that's a good idea to go for. Yeah. And the mouse one, I thought it was a good idea, because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing. Um. Project Manager : Yeah. I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five, User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use. User Interface : S yeah. So they'd be able to use that um, as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen. Project Manager : Yeah. User Interface : Um so there you go. Project Manager : And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker, so {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Oh. User Interface : So that's um the user interface Project Manager : 'Kay. User Interface : design. Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} Industrial Designer : Okay. User Interface : So okay, I'll take this out now then. Industrial Designer : Um so Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : There you go. Industrial Designer : I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among, Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah, looks like it. Industrial Designer : and I'll I'll give you the uh, {vocalsound} I guess, technical considerations for those. User Interface : Mm. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Uh {vocalsound} User Interface : {gap} Industrial Designer : And I'm gonna use the whiteboard, just 'cause we haven't used it {vocalsound}. Project Manager : Yeah, I was just thinking the self same thing. {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Right. So, the way I'm gonna do this {vocalsound} is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls, see how they work, uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it, Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : and then we'll throw in our new innovations um {vocalsound} and keep it all within budget. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Magic man. Industrial Designer : So uh yeah, looking inside a a very simple remote control. Um this is what they sent me. 'Kay. Here's uh the competition, I suppose. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Um you open it up, there's a circuit board inside, Project Manager : Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer : um {vocalsound} and there's a a chip, a processor, the T_A_ one one eight three five, which um receives input from the buttons, and ch Project Manager : So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip, is it? Industrial Designer : Right, it's very {disfmarker} they're very cheap remote. This remote costs nothing, you know. Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier, which is made of some transistors and amplifiers, op-amps, and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light, which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end, User Interface : Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer : and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television. Project Manager : Right. Industrial Designer : Oh here it is. {vocalsound} Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control, because it it defines the uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : Okay. So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or? Industrial Designer : R Um no, I mean this is a very old one, so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make. Project Manager : They gotta be {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Almost a key-ring. {gap} Industrial Designer : Right. So this is what we need to have for certain. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay. Industrial Designer : Um. So you know, as we said, we got the outer casing, which we have to decide, you know, what's it gonna be, um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up, processor, um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had, amplifier and transmitter are all standard. Um so for the casing, uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh, you know, we have a bunch of options from wood, titanium, rubber, plastic, whatnot, um latex, double-curved, curved. So lots of choices, User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : 'Kay. Industrial Designer : what do we think? Uh or sponge, I guess, isn't on there, right. Project Manager : Well. User Interface : Mm. I'm not sure about the sponge. Industrial Designer : Organic sponge. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Well, I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it, doesn't it. Industrial Designer : Uh yeah, it's very elasticy for sure. Project Manager : Um {disfmarker} Yeah. And that would k also give it kinda durability User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : and User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Um. Project Manager : and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast. Industrial Designer : Yeah so {disfmarker} Project Manager : Um {vocalsound} so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic {disfmarker} initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath? Industrial Designer : Okay so, here are a a plastic, uh latex {disfmarker} User Interface : I like the rubber, the stress balls, I think, Project Manager : Oh right, okay. User Interface : you know, that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Oh right. Project Manager : I don't know what that stuff is. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : So something with give to it. Project Manager : Yeah. User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay. And User Interface : And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around. Industrial Designer : and the colour is yellow, right? User Interface : Yeah, Project Manager : Or at least incorporating, yeah. {vocalsound} User Interface : y {vocalsound} yellow incorporated, yeah. Industrial Designer : Yellow {vocalsound}, okay. Um. Project Manager : I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh {disfmarker} I don't know what other standard silver kind of {disfmarker} User Interface : I think {disfmarker} Project Manager : Other parts or uh {disfmarker} User Interface : Mm. Yeah, the buttons w like, 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours Project Manager : Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer : Mm' kay. User Interface : or i if we're having buttons actually, Industrial Designer : So yellow for the body, User Interface : I don Project Manager : Um. Industrial Designer : and then what colour for the buttons? Project Manager : Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself. User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : So multi-coloured buttons. User Interface : You do have ones like um play {vocalsound} could be green or on and off is red, and stuff like that, yeah. Industrial Designer : {gap} Project Manager : Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish, perhaps. User Interface : {vocalsound} Makes it easy to use. Yeah, that's true, because that blue one did look quite hardish. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Okay. Project Manager : Yeah. {vocalsound} Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well. I mean if we are gonna make it a novel {disfmarker} I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use, Industrial Designer : Okay. User Interface : Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Project Manager : a bit comfier, you know. User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go {disfmarker} Um how exactly? Maybe double {disfmarker} User Interface : Like uh {vocalsound} an hour glass kind of figure, is that what you're thinking of, Project Manager : Yeah it's uh, yeah, that that'd be {disfmarker} that's sort of comfortable to hold, easy to hold so you don't drop it. User Interface : or just like a {disfmarker} It's not {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : What about a banana? User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} We could make novelty remote controls. Industrial Designer : Yeah? Okay, like we could have a big banana shaped remote control, Project Manager : Well, yeah, I mean like {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : 'cause it's yellow fruit, User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : right? Project Manager : Yeah, yeah. Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip. Yeah. {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah. But then how would you point it? Marketing : Ah Industrial Designer : {gap} Marketing : yeah. Mm-hmm. User Interface : How would you point it? Industrial Designer : Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point, I guess. User Interface : What {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end. Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah, I appreciate this idea, Project Manager : They only cost pennies. User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : because then this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this will help us in our advertisement also Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : and we can relate with fruits and vegetables, the people's choices. That what our data shows that, so this w this w User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : Huh? User Interface : {gap} y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea. Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Um. Industrial Designer : So a spongy banana re {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} I mean that that th {vocalsound} User Interface : Rubber banana. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Project Manager : does User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay. Project Manager : it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe. {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah. Industrial Designer : Okay, okay. User Interface : I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape. And what else did you say about fashions? What was trendy? Marketing : Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables, Project Manager : {vocalsound} S Industrial Designer : See {disfmarker} Marketing : like people uh now {disfmarker} Project Manager : And sponginess. Industrial Designer : So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable User Interface : And spongy, yeah. Marketing : Spongy. User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : like so it would have a stem perhaps User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : and a User Interface : Maybe, yeah. Industrial Designer : maybe a {disfmarker} it'd be s axially symmetric. Project Manager : Huh. User Interface : Like what's what's that {vocalsound}, I don't even know the name of it, some kind of, you know where it's like {disfmarker} looks like a little snowman kind of thing. I don't know the name of that. Industrial Designer : So it'd look like this kinda. User Interface : Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Industrial Designer : Like a gourd almost, or a squash of some sort? Project Manager : Uh. User Interface : Yeah, maybe that's what they are. Project Manager : {gap} User Interface : 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit Industrial Designer : Yeah, User Interface : and {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say, you know, it transmits from this end. User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah, why the hell not. {vocalsound} Let's {vocalsound} that'll make us fifty million Euros. User Interface : I don't know. What do you guy {disfmarker} What do you think? Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Um. Well, I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape, User Interface : No. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Project Manager : yeah? User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : Yeah, then only we can relate it with something. Project Manager : Yeah, we can relate it by advertising or {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah. Exactly. Industrial Designer : Okay, so double-curved, single-curved, what do we feel? Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} Or we can do something, we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey, let the public choose what they want. User Interface : Uh-huh. Industrial Designer : Okay. Project Manager : There's a good man. There's a good idea. User Interface : Okay. Industrial Designer : Okay um, I guess, since you're the marketing guy. Marketing : Yeah, sure. I will be happy to do that. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : We'll uh {disfmarker} Okay, we could do that. Um. User Interface : Okay. And buttons would, did we say? Uh different shapes of buttons? Industrial Designer : {gap} Project Manager : Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions, you know, up and down, uh play, stop. User Interface : Mm. Industrial Designer : Okay, so Project Manager : They've got, I mean, they've got standard sort of intuitive um Industrial Designer : so buttons. Project Manager : things that are always used. Industrial Designer : Okay, just like that. User Interface : {gap} {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} That's cool. User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : {vocalsound} I like it. Industrial Designer : Okay. Project Manager : Um. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : With the scroll-wheel or no? User Interface : Yeah, what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition? {vocalsound} Project Manager : Uh speech recognition, I think, so we need a microphone presumably. Industrial Designer : Okay uh I could put the microphone here. {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer : Okay there's the microphone. Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Where should I put the microphone? Project Manager : I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use? User Interface : Yeah, I'm not sure. Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration, I think. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Glad, we're not doing this for real. User Interface : Um yeah, I can {disfmarker} no I'm not sure. Industrial Designer : Okay, well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels, right? User Interface : I couldn Yeah. Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Okay. Project Manager : And uh I think if this this new software for the Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"
559,"Project Manager : Yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition . Industrial Designer : The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . Marketing : That that's uh {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah , but it's t Marketing : Yes , four points . Project Manager : And then you can keep the curve . User Interface : Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , Project Manager : Or can't you ? User Interface : it is something special . Industrial Designer : Yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? User Interface : I don't know . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : F You have to {disfmarker} we have to scrap four points . User Interface : Yeah , that's difficult . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Or make it on a hand dynamo , but {vocalsound} I don't think that will work . User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? Industrial Designer : No , that's {disfmarker} no . User Interface : Uh . Industrial Designer : Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ? User Interface : {vocalsound} We could make it titanium instead of rubber . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} You don't make a remote control of {disfmarker} Ah . Marketing : Yeah , Project Manager : Yeah , Marketing : it it i Project Manager : mm-hmm . Marketing : Yeah , it also {disfmarker} uh it also takes one point less . Project Manager : Yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , User Interface : Oh . Oh can I ask something ? Project Manager : yes ? User Interface : What is special colour ? Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Is that the wood uh wood uh {disfmarker} Marketing : I think it is . User Interface : this , we have to have that one too ? Industrial Designer : It isn't . Project Manager : Yeah , Industrial Designer : What ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : but it's only a half . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . Marketing : Yeah . Sample speaker . Industrial Designer : To knock the sample speaker , yeah . And sample sensor . User Interface : Th then we still have too much Marketing : Yeah , okay , User Interface : if we use the uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : But m yeah , course , Marketing : three . Point three . Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah , we we scrap that one ? Industrial Designer : What we'll have . {vocalsound} Marketing : Huh ? Industrial Designer : Let's make it thirteen or fourteen . {vocalsound} User Interface : See , a po Marketing : Point twelve {gap} . User Interface : three . {vocalsound} We need point three . {vocalsound} Marketing : That's a scroll wheel . {vocalsound} User Interface : Uh it's a colour . Don't make it wood . Industrial Designer : A colour . Marketing : Yeah , but a wood {disfmarker} User Interface : Make it uh {disfmarker} Marketing : we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . User Interface : Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it a all kind of colours ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , special colours , fruity colours . User Interface : It's also green or uh {disfmarker} Marketing : Is it also {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : no that that's just normal colour {disfmarker} fruit colours . User Interface : Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . Marketing : Normal colours , yellow {disfmarker} User Interface : You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : You don't say here's green rubber . Industrial Designer : They don't sell green rubber plants . {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . Industrial Designer : Alright . User Interface : Yeah , you can , you should {disfmarker} you have to lose {disfmarker} Marketing : But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh User Interface : No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess . Industrial Designer : No no no . Marketing : s advanced chip . No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? Industrial Designer : If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen Marketing : Five ? Then we have two . User Interface : A push , Marketing : S User Interface : yeah . Marketing : touch . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} then it's possible to make . And then you can {vocalsound} and then you can add to the colours . Marketing : Then we can make {disfmarker} add two colours on it . Yeah , two colours {gap} it . Industrial Designer : Special c User Interface : Switch colours . Industrial Designer : Okay , if you lose uh {vocalsound} if you lose the {disfmarker} User Interface : It was such a great idea . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : You lose this one , you got eleven point five Marketing : They can add two colours . Industrial Designer : and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example . Marketing : But the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : How d uh uh how many colours ? User Interface : What do you mean ? Industrial Designer : Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p Marketing : Yeah , but we we we are {disfmarker} we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . Industrial Designer : Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour . User Interface : Oh . Marketing : Ah okay . User Interface : But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , Industrial Designer : I suppose . User Interface : 'cause you have to add it . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . User Interface : Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . You co you could make it always black , like normal remote . Marketing : Yeah b Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow {disfmarker} uh red , and then you add {disfmarker} you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . Industrial Designer : Nee we we also want to make ano another colour . User Interface : Oh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u Marketing : Yeah , but m User Interface : Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . Marketing : Yeah , User Interface : That's what it means . Marketing : because we have more colours than only black . Project Manager : Yeah , but isn't it per remote that you pay ? User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : I {disfmarker} then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special {disfmarker} Project Manager : Half ? User Interface : Oh right , yeah . Is it per remote ? Project Manager : I think you pay half per remote . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah , that's right , Project Manager : So each remote with a special colour . User Interface : and you {disfmarker} one colour per remote . Industrial Designer : Yeah , indeed , yeah . User Interface : So then it is one . Industrial Designer : You don't need four of those {vocalsound} uh four of those special colours in one in one remote . Marketing : Yeah , okay okay , true . True , true . User Interface : No . Project Manager : I hope . {vocalsound} Marketing : We have two points spare . Project Manager : So the battery , Marketing : Nee one point . Project Manager : we have um advanced chip on print . User Interface : One . So it would be curved , single curve . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Because of {disfmarker} thing {disfmarker} User Interface : Or not ? Project Manager : Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again . Industrial Designer : Hmm . User Interface : So y you just can't make a nice remote . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah , single curve . Project Manager : Because that was very important , User Interface : It's too bad for the speaker . Project Manager : huh ?

Oh can I ask something? Project Manager : yes? User Interface : What is special colour? Marketing : Yeah. User Interface : Is that the wood uh wood uh {disfmarker} Marketing : I think it is. User Interface : this, we have to have that one too? Industrial Designer : It isn't. Project Manager : Yeah, Industrial Designer : What? Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : but it's only a half. But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker. Marketing : Yeah. Sample speaker. Industrial Designer : To knock the sample speaker, yeah. And sample sensor.

Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah, we we scrap that one? Industrial Designer : What we'll have. {vocalsound} Marketing : Huh? Industrial Designer : Let's make it thirteen or fourteen. {vocalsound} User Interface : See, a po Marketing : Point twelve {gap}. User Interface : three. {vocalsound} We need point three. {vocalsound} Marketing : That's a scroll wheel. {vocalsound} User Interface : Uh it's a colour. Don't make it wood. Industrial Designer : A colour. Marketing : Yeah, but a wood {disfmarker} User Interface : Make it uh {disfmarker} Marketing : we can make it brown, dark brown, not wood. User Interface : Yeah, but it's it's special colour, is it a all kind of colours? Industrial Designer : Yeah, special colours, fruity colours. User Interface : It's also green or uh {disfmarker} Marketing : Is it also {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : no that that's just normal colour {disfmarker} fruit colours. User Interface : Yeah, but it's a special colour than just rubber colour. Marketing : Normal colours, yellow {disfmarker} User Interface : You have to add something to the rubber to make it green. Industrial Designer : Yeah. User Interface : You don't say here's green rubber. Industrial Designer : They don't sell green rubber plants. {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah, but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half. Industrial Designer : Alright. User Interface : Yeah, you can, you should {disfmarker} you have to lose {disfmarker} Marketing : But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display, we have to scrap uh User Interface : No, it is the scroll wheel, I guess. Industrial Designer : No no no. Marketing : s advanced chip. No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make? Industrial Designer : If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen Marketing : Five? Then we have two. User Interface : A push, Marketing : S User Interface : yeah. Marketing : touch. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} then it's possible to make. And then you can {vocalsound} and then you can add to the colours. Marketing : Then we can make {disfmarker} add two colours on it. Yeah, two colours {gap} it. Industrial Designer : Special c User Interface : Switch colours. Industrial Designer : Okay, if you lose uh {vocalsound} if you lose the {disfmarker} User Interface : It was such a great idea. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : You lose this one, you got eleven point five Marketing : They can add two colours. Industrial Designer : and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve, for example. Marketing : But the colours. Um how ma uh the colours like l she told, is that all the colours we add or {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : How d uh uh how many colours? User Interface : What do you mean? Industrial Designer : Special colours, all the colours you want, because you want to make p Marketing : Yeah, but we we we are {disfmarker} we have yellow, red, uh black, titanium. Industrial Designer : Yeah, but uh when you use more than one colour, it's a special colour. User Interface : Oh. Marketing : Ah okay. User Interface : But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour, Industrial Designer : I suppose. User Interface : 'cause you have to add it. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : Yeah, but the rubbers alls original black. User Interface : Yeah, so you always lose the special colour. You co you could make it always black, like normal remote. Marketing : Yeah b Yeah, but we're gonna make it yellow {disfmarker} uh red, and then you add {disfmarker} you have two special colours on top of the one we have now. Industrial Designer : Nee we we also want to make ano another colour. User Interface : Oh right, yeah. Yeah, we should u Marketing : Yeah, but m User Interface : Yeah. We have to make this like four or five or something. Marketing : Yeah, User Interface : That's what it means. Marketing : because we have more colours than only black. Project Manager : Yeah, but isn't it per remote that you pay? User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : I {disfmarker} then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special {disfmarker} Project Manager : Half? User Interface : Oh right, yeah. Is it per remote? Project Manager : I think you pay half per remote. User Interface : Yeah. Yeah, that's right, Project Manager : So each remote with a special colour. User Interface : and you {disfmarker} one colour per remote. Industrial Designer : Yeah, indeed, yeah. User Interface : So then it is one. Industrial Designer : You don't need four of those {vocalsound} uh four of those special colours in one in one remote. Marketing : Yeah, okay okay, true. True, true. User Interface : No. Project Manager : I hope. {vocalsound} Marketing : We have two points spare. Project Manager : So the battery, Marketing : Nee one point. Project Manager : we have um advanced chip on print. User Interface : One. So it would be curved, single curve. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Because of {disfmarker} thing {disfmarker} User Interface : Or not? Project Manager : Yeah, well you can at least make it curved again. Industrial Designer : Hmm. User Interface : So y you just can't make a nice remote. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah, single curve. Project Manager : Because that was very important, User Interface : It's too bad for the speaker. Project Manager : huh?

So maybe I can switch slides when you {disfmarker} whenever you ask, Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : that will be more convenient. So okay, functional requirements. Marketing : Okay so you can {disfmarker} you can go. Okay so {vocalsound} in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects Project Manager : Mm. Marketing : and the subjects also filled a questionnaire Project Manager : Yeah. Marketing : okay? And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more {vocalsound} more nice, more kind. Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy. {vocalsound} Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : oh {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} it's not good. {vocalsound} So okay. Project Manager : We can just keep doing that? Marketing : So it's not in theory {disfmarker} but I I can I can say yeah. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah. Marketing : Fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot. So mm {vocalsound} we have to have a remote control uh very um {vocalsound} out for that. {vocalsound} Uh the buttons have {disfmarker} are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks. Project Manager : Okay. Marketing : {vocalsound} Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh {vocalsound} ten per cents of but of the buttons in the {disfmarker} in the remote control. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Okay. Marketing : So all the buttons we we have to put are {disfmarker} have to to have um a use a real use Project Manager : Okay. Marketing : and not only or {disfmarker} Project Manager : Okay, so fewer buttons maybe would be good? Marketing : Yeah. F not many buttons, and uh and uh uh u useable buttons {vocalsound}. Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : But what kind of remote controls did you look at? Marketing : Sorry? User Interface : What kind of task was it? It was a T_V_? Marketing : Yeah. Uh {vocalsound} most for most is T_V_. Project Manager : Yeah. Yeah but in fact we {disfmarker} it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management User Interface : Huh. Project Manager : bo I will present them in the following. User Interface : Uh-huh. Ah! Good. Marketing : {vocalsound} 'Kay you can go so. Project Manager : Okay. Marketing : So there are other frustrations expressed by users, so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to {vocalsound} to Project Manager : Yeah. To find it. Marketing : to find it. Project Manager : Yeah. Marketing : Um and um lot of the time they {disfmarker} it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. Project Manager : Yeah. Marketing : So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use. Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : Okay. Marketing : And uh remote controls are bad for Project Manager : What is her other side? Marketing : R_S_I_ {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} User Interface : Other side yeah, yo wa your wrist Marketing : I dunno.

Yeah yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel. Project Manager : Yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the {disfmarker} Project Manager : Okay. Marketing : and uh and not uh a lot for setting {disfmarker} for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that. Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : Mm-hmm. Marketing : So it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah. This function should be very uh accessible. Marketing : Very accessible yes. Project Manager : Yeah, okay. This is the main function okay. Marketing : That's right. {vocalsound} So then we asked some questions to them Project Manager : Yeah.

Industrial Designer : Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session ? User Interface : Yeah . Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ? Project Manager : Yeah . Because then we have a {disfmarker} User Interface : After that we are going to the conceptual uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Y you do some individual work , Marketing : We're just working the three phases . Project Manager : we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare {disfmarker} uh I have to defend our design , User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : so make it good . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah okay . We'll do our best . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : I depend on you . User Interface : Okay . Marketing : {vocalsound} Better make it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . Project Manager : Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Do we {disfmarker} I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah . {vocalsound} That is my question also Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : because like new new functions {disfmarker} Project Manager : Well I think that is the user requirements part . Marketing : Requirements . Yeah . Project Manager : As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah . True . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But but we need good communication about this stuff , Marketing : Unit . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : 'cause I have to f put the components into the design . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : I would first m Industrial Designer : So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . Marketing : Yeah well Project Manager : Yeah I understand . Marketing : I I was {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them . Marketing : Yeah Project Manager : You can always add a few {disfmarker} Marketing : well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : So you can switch to your video Project Manager : Hmm , Marketing : and then the same buttons control your video . Project Manager : the C_D_ player . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . Industrial Designer : Yeah so {disfmarker} Marketing : And then use your Windows media centre {vocalsound} under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch {gap} Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . Marketing : S Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . Marketing : Yeah Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . Marketing : records and stuff like that . Industrial Designer : And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , Marketing : No . Project Manager : You need additional {disfmarker} yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : so I kind of need to know what we uh need . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh in here Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting . Marketing : In the project uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : So we have a basic starting point Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : So it's hasn't {gap} {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} yeah .

649,"Postdoc F : OK , it 's {disfmarker} it 's very {pause} eh {disfmarker} it 's {pause} very brief , I mean {disfmarker} just let me {disfmarker} just hand these out . Oops . Grad H : Is this the same as the email or different ? PhD C : Thanks . Postdoc F : It 's slightly different . I {disfmarker} {pause} basically the same . Grad H : OK . PhD A : Same idea ? Postdoc F : But , same idea . So , if you 've looked at this you 've seen it before , so {pause} Basically , {vocalsound} um {pause} as you know , uh {pause} part of the encoding {pause} includes a mark that indicates {pause} an overlap . It 's not indicated {pause} with , um {pause} uh , tight precision , it 's just indicated that {disfmarker} OK , so , It 's indicated to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} so the people know {pause} what parts of sp which {disfmarker} which stretches of speech were in the clear , versus being overlapped by others . So , I {pause} used this mark and , um {pause} and , uh {pause} uh , {pause} divided the {disfmarker} I wrote a script {pause} which divides things into individual minutes , {pause} of which we ended up with forty {pause} five , and a little bit . And , uh {pause} you know , minute zero , of course , is the first minute up to {pause} sixty seconds . PhD C : OK . Postdoc F : And , um {pause} What you can see is the number of overlaps {pause} and then {pause} to the right , {pause} whether they involve two speakers , three speakers , or more than three speakers . And , {pause} um {pause} and , what I was looking for sp sp specifically was the question of {pause} whether they 're distributed evenly throughout or whether they 're {pause} bursts of them . Um . And {pause} it looked to me as though {disfmarker} uh , you know {disfmarker} y this is just {disfmarker} {pause} eh {disfmarker} eh , this would {disfmarker} this is not statistically {pause} verified , {pause} but it {pause} did look to me as though there are bursts throughout , rather than being {pause} localized to a particular region . The part down there , where there 's the maximum number of {disfmarker} {pause} of , um {pause} overlaps is an area where we were discussing {pause} {vocalsound} whether or not it would be useful to indi to s to {pause} code {pause} stress , {pause} uh , sentence stress {pause} as possible indication of , uh {pause} information retrieval . So it 's like , {pause} you know , rather , {pause} lively discussion there . Professor D : What was {disfmarker} what 's the {disfmarker} the parenthesized stuff {pause} that says , like {disfmarker} e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ? Postdoc F : Oh , th {vocalsound} {pause} That 's the per cent . Professor D : Mmm . Postdoc F : So , six is , uh {pause} two point eight percent {pause} of the total number of overlaps in the {pause} session . PhD E : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Ah . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Postdoc F : At the very end , this is when people were , {pause} you know , packing up to go basically , there 's {pause} this final stuff , I think we {disfmarker} {pause} I don't remember where the digits {pause} fell . I 'd have to look at that . But {pause} the final three there are no overlaps at all . And {pause} couple times there {pause} are not . PhD E : Mm - hmm . Postdoc F : So , i it seems like it goes through bursts {pause} but , um {pause} that 's kind of it . PhD E : Mm - hmm . Postdoc F : Now , {pause} Another question is {pause} is there {disfmarker} are there {pause} individual differences in whether you 're likely to be overlapped with or to overlap with others . And , again {pause} I want to emphasize this is just one {pause} particular {pause} um {disfmarker} {pause} one particular meeting , and also there 's been no statistical testing of it all , but {pause} I , um {pause} I took the coding of {pause} the {disfmarker} I , you know , my {disfmarker} I had this script {pause} figure out , um {pause} who {pause} was the first speaker , who was the second speaker involved in a two - person overlap , I didn't look at the ones involving three or more . And , um {pause} {pause} this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of {pause} who tended to be overlapping most often with who {disfmarker} who else , and {pause} if you look at the marginal totals , which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom , you get {pause} the totals for an individual . So , {vocalsound} um {pause} If you {pause} look at the bottom , those are the , um {pause} numbers of overlaps in which {pause} um {pause} Adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look {disfmarker} I 'm sorry , but you 're o alphabetical , that 's why I 'm choosing you And then if you look across the right , {pause} then {pause} that 's where he was the {pause} person who was the sp first speaker in the pair {pause} and got overlap overlapped with by somebody . PhD A : Hmm ! PhD E : Mm - hmm . Postdoc F : And , {pause} then if you look down in the summary table , {pause} then you see that , um {pause} th they 're differences in {pause} whether a person got overlapped with or {pause} overlapped by . Grad H : Is this uh {pause} just raw counts or is it {disfmarker} Postdoc F : Raw counts . Grad H : So it would be interesting to see how much each person spoke . PhD B : Mm - hmm . PhD C : Yeah . PhD E : Yeah {vocalsound} Yeah Postdoc F : Yes , very true {disfmarker} very true Grad H : Normalized to how much {disfmarker} Postdoc F : it would be good to normalize with respect to that . Now on the table I did {pause} take one step toward , uh {pause} away from the raw frequencies by putting , {pause} uh {pause} percentages . So that the percentage of time {pause} of the {disfmarker} of the times that a person spoke , {pause} what percentage {pause} eh , w so . Of the times a person spoke and furthermore was involved in a two two - person overlap , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} what percentage of the time were they the overlapper and what percent of the time were they th the overlappee ? And there , it looks like you see some differences , um , {pause} that some people tend to be overlapped {pause} with more often than they 're overlapped , but , of course , uh i e {vocalsound} this is just one meeting , {pause} uh {pause} there 's no statistical testing involved , and that would be {pause} required for a {disfmarker} for a finding {pause} of {pause} any {pause} kind of {pause} scientific {pause} reliability . Professor D : S so , i it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something . Grad H : No {disfmarker} no actually , that would be actually statistically correct , Professor D : Yeah , yeah . Postdoc F : No , no , no . PhD E : Yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah . Grad H : but Postdoc F : Yeah , that 's right . Professor D : Yeah . Excuse me . Postdoc F : That 's right . And I 'm {pause} you know , I 'm {disfmarker} I don't see a point of singling people out , Professor D : B I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I rather enjoyed it , but {disfmarker} but this Postdoc F : now , this is a case where obviously {disfmarker} PhD A : But the numbers speak for themselves . PhD E : He 's {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah , yeah . Postdoc F : Well , {vocalsound} you know , it 's like {disfmarker} I 'm not {disfmarker} I 'm not saying on the tape who did {pause} better or worse Grad H : Yes , that 's right , so you don't nee OK . Professor D : Sure . Postdoc F : because {pause} I don't think that it 's {disfmarker} I {pause} you know , and {disfmarker} and th here 's a case where of course , human subjects people would say be sure that you anonymize the results , {pause} and {disfmarker} and , so , might as well do this . Professor D : Yeah . Grad H : Yeah , when {disfmarker} this is what {disfmarker} This is actually {disfmarker} when Jane sent this email first , is what caused me to start thinking about anonymizing the data . Postdoc F : Well , fair enough . Fair enough . Professor D : Yeah . Postdoc F : And actually , {pause} you know , the point is not about an individual , it 's the point about {pause} tendencies toward {pause} you know , different styles , different speaker styles . Professor D : Oh sure . Postdoc F : And {pause} it would be , you know {pause} of course , {pause} there 's also the question of what type of overlap was this , and w what were they , and i and I {disfmarker} and I know that I can distinguish at least three types and , probably more , I mean , the {vocalsound} general {pause} {vocalsound} cultural idea which w uh , the conversation analysts originally started with in the seventies was that we have this {vocalsound} strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th before you start talking , and {pause} and you know , I mean , {pause} w we know that {disfmarker} {pause} an and they 've loosened up on that too s in the intervening time , that {pause} that that 's {disfmarker} that 's viewed as being {pause} a culturally - relative thing , I mean , {pause} that you have the high - involvement style from the East Coast where people {vocalsound} will overlap often as an indication of interest in what the other person is saying . And Grad H : Uh - huh . PhD B : Exactly ! Postdoc F : Yeah , exactly ! PhD E : Yeah Postdoc F : Well , there you go . Fine , that 's alright , that 's OK . And {disfmarker} and , {pause} you know , in contrast , so Deborah {disfmarker} d and also Deborah Tannen 's {pause} thesis she talked about differences of these types , {pause} that they 're just different styles , and it 's um {pause} you {disfmarker} you can't impose a model of {disfmarker} {pause} there {disfmarker} of the ideal being no overlaps , and {pause} you know , conversational analysts also agree with that , so it 's {pause} now , universally {pause} a ag agreed with . And {disfmarker} and , als I mean , I can't say universally , but anyway , the people who used to say it was strict , {pause} um {pause} now , uh {pause} don't . I mean they {disfmarker} they {pause} also {pause} {vocalsound} you know , uh {pause} uh , ack acknowledge the influence of {pause} sub of subcultural norms and {pause} cross - cultural norms and things . So , um Then it beco {pause} though {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just superficially to give {pause} um {pause} a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved , I have at the bottom several that I noticed . So , {pause} {vocalsound} uh , there are backchannels , like what Adam just did now and , um {pause} {vocalsound} um , anticipating the end of a question and {pause} simply answering it earlier , and there are several of those in this {disfmarker} in these data where {disfmarker} PhD B : Mm - hmm . Postdoc F : because we 're {pause} people who 've talked to each other , um {pause} we know {pause} basically what the topic is , what the possibilities are and w and we 've spoken with each other so we know basically what the other person 's style is likely to be and so {vocalsound} and t there are a number of places where someone just answered early . No problem . And places {pause} also which I thought were interesting , where two or more people gave exactly th the same answer in unison {disfmarker} different words of course but you know , the {disfmarker} basically , {pause} you know everyone 's saying "" yes "" or {disfmarker} you know , or ev even more sp specific than that . So , uh , the point is that , um {pause} {vocalsound} overlap 's not necessarily a bad thing and that it would be im {pause} i useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved . And that 's all I wanted to say on that , {pause} unless people have questions . Professor D : Well , of course th the biggest , {pause} um {pause} result here , which is one we 've {disfmarker} {pause} we 've talked about many times and isn't new to us , but which I think would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this {vocalsound} {pause} is just the sheer number of overlaps . Grad H : Yep . Professor D : That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Right ? {pause} that {disfmarker} that , um PhD E : Yes , yes ! Postdoc F : Oh , OK {disfmarker} interesting . PhD E : Yeah . Professor D : here 's a relatively short meeting , it 's a forty {disfmarker} {pause} forty plus minute {pause} {vocalsound} meeting , and not only were there two hundred and fifteen overlaps {vocalsound} {pause} but , {pause} uh I think there 's one {disfmarker} {pause} one minute there where there {disfmarker} where {disfmarker} where there wasn't any overlap ? Grad H : Hundred ninety - seven . Professor D : I mean , it 's {disfmarker} {pause} {vocalsound} uh throughout this thing ? PhD A : It 'd be interesting {disfmarker} Professor D : It 's {disfmarker} You have {disfmarker} Postdoc F : Well , at the bottom , you have the bottom three . PhD E : Yeah . Grad H : S n are {disfmarker} Postdoc F : So four {disfmarker} four minutes all together with none {disfmarker} none . PhD A : But it w Professor D : Oh , so the bottom three did have s stuff going on ? There was speech ? Postdoc F : Yes , uh - huh . Yeah . But just no overlaps . Professor D : OK , so if {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} PhD A : It 'd be interesting to see what the total amount of time is in the overlaps , versus {disfmarker} Postdoc F : Yes , exactly and that 's {disfmarker} that 's where Jose 's pro project comes in . PhD E : Yeah , yeah , I h I have this that infor I have th that information now . PhD G : I was about to ask {disfmarker} PhD A : Yeah . PhD C : Yeah . PhD B : Hmm . Professor D : Oh , about how much is it ? PhD E : The {disfmarker} the duration of eh {disfmarker} of each of the overlaps . Professor D : O oh , what 's {disfmarker} what 's the {disfmarker} what 's the average {pause} length ? PhD E : M I {disfmarker} I haven't averaged it now but , uh {pause} I {disfmarker} I will , uh I will do the {disfmarker} the study of the {disfmarker} {pause} with the {disfmarker} with the program with the {disfmarker} uh , the different , uh {pause} the , nnn , {pause} distribution of the duration of the overlaps . Professor D : You don't know ? OK , you {disfmarker} you don you don't have a feeling for roughly how {pause} much it is ? Yeah . PhD E : mmm , {pause} Because the {disfmarker} the uh , @ @ is @ @ . Professor D : Yeah . PhD E : The duration is , uh {pause} the variation {disfmarker} the variation of the duration is uh , very big on the dat PhD A : Mm - hmm . Postdoc F : I suspect that it will also differ , {pause} depending on the type of overlap {pause} involved . PhD E : but eh {disfmarker} Professor D : Oh , I 'm sure . PhD E : Yeah . Postdoc F : So backchannels will be very brief PhD E : Because , on your surface eh {pause} a bit of zone of overlapping with the duration eh , overlapped and another very very short . Postdoc F : and {disfmarker} Professor D : Yeah . Yeah . PhD E : Uh , i probably it 's very difficult to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} because the {disfmarker} the overlap is , uh on is only the {disfmarker} in the final "" S "" of the {disfmarker} of the {disfmarker} the fin the {disfmarker} the end {disfmarker} the end word of the , um {pause} previous speaker {vocalsound} with the {disfmarker} the next word of the {disfmarker} the new speaker . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD E : Um , I considered {pause} that 's an overlap but it 's very short , it 's an "" X "" with a {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} the idea is probably , eh {pause} when eh {disfmarker} when eh , we studied th th that zone , eh {pause} {pause} eh , we h we have eh eh {pause} confusion with eh eh noise . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD E : With eh {pause} that fricative sounds , but uh {pause} I have new information but I have to {disfmarker} to study . Professor D : Yeah . Yeah , but I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} u PhD G : Can I {disfmarker} Professor D : go ahead . Postdoc F : Yeah . PhD G : You split this by minute , um {pause} so if an overlap straddles {pause} the boundary between two minutes , that counts towards both of those minutes . Postdoc F : Yes . Mm - hmm . Actually , um {vocalsound} um {pause} actually not . Uh , so {pause} le let 's think about the case where {vocalsound} A starts speaking {pause} {vocalsound} and then B overlaps with A , {pause} and then the minute boundary happens . And let 's say that {vocalsound} after that minute boundary , {vocalsound} um {pause} B is still speaking , {pause} and A overlaps {pause} with B , that would be a new overlap . But otherwise {pause} um , let 's say B {pause} comes to the conclusion of {disfmarker} of that turn without {pause} anyone overlapping with him or her , in which case there would be no overlap counted in that second minute . PhD G : No , but suppose they both talk simultaneously {vocalsound} {pause} both a {disfmarker} a portion of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two . Postdoc F : OK . In that case , um {pause} my c {pause} the coding that I was using {disfmarker} {vocalsound} since we haven't , {pause} uh {pause} incorporated Adam 's , uh {pause} coding of overlap yets , the coding of Yeah , "" yets "" is not a word . Uh {vocalsound} since we haven't incorporated Adam 's method of handling overl overlaps yet {vocalsound} um {pause} then {pause} that would have fallen through the cra cracks . It would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because , um {pause} I wou I wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was {pause} encoded so far . Professor D : I I Postdoc F : We just haven't done th the precise second to sec you know , {pause} second to second coding of when they occur . Professor D : I I I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm confused now . So l l let me restate what I thought Andreas was saying and {disfmarker} and see . Postdoc F : Uh - huh . Professor D : Let 's say that in {disfmarker} in second fifty - seven {pause} {vocalsound} of one minute , {pause} you start talking and I start talking and {pause} we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds . Postdoc F : Yep . OK . Mm - hmm . Professor D : So we go over {disfmarker} So we were {disfmarker} we were talking over one another , {pause} and it 's just {disfmarker} in each case , it 's just sort of one {pause} interval . Right ? Postdoc F : Mm - hmm ? Professor D : So , um {pause} we talked over the minute boundary . Is this {pause} considered as one overlap in each of the minutes , the way you have done this . Postdoc F : No , it wouldn't . It would be considered as an overlap in the first one . Professor D : OK , so that 's {pause} good , i I think , in the sense that I think Andreas meant the question , PhD B : That 's {disfmarker} {pause} that 's good , yeah , cuz the overall rate is {disfmarker} PhD C :  PhD G : Yeah . Grad H : Statistical . PhD B : Yeah . Postdoc F : Mm - hmm . Professor D : right ? Postdoc F : Yeah . They 're not double counted . PhD G : Other - otherwise you 'd get double counts , here and there . Grad H : Yep . PhD B : Ah but , yeah . PhD E : Yeah . PhD B :  PhD G : And then it would be harder {disfmarker} Professor D : Yeah . PhD E : Yeah . Postdoc F : I should also say I did a simplifying , uh {pause} count in that {vocalsound} if A was speaking {pause} B overlapped with A and then A came back again and overlapped with B again , I {disfmarker} I didn't count that as a three - person overlap , I counted that as a two - person overlap , {pause} and it was A being overlapped with by D . Grad H : Mm - hmm . Postdoc F : Because the idea was the first speaker {pause} had the floor {pause} and the second person {pause} started speaking and then the f the first person reasserted the floor {pause} kind of thing . PhD B : Yeah . Postdoc F : These are simplifying assumptions , didn't happen very often , there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing . Grad H : I want to go back and listen to minute forty - one . Postdoc F : Yeah , yeah . Grad H : Cuz i i I find it interesting that there were a large number of overlaps and they were all two - speaker . Professor D : Yeah . Grad H : I mean what I thought {disfmarker} what I would have thought in {pause} is that when there were a large number of overlaps , it was because everyone was talking at once , {vocalsound} but uh apparently not . Postdoc F : That 's interesting . That 's interesting . PhD E : Yeah . Yeah . Mmm . Grad H : That 's really neat . Professor D : Yeah . Postdoc F : Yeah , there 's a lot of backchannel , a lot o a lot of {disfmarker} Grad H : This is {pause} really interesting data . Postdoc F : Yeah , it is . PhD B : I think what 's really interesting though , it is {pause} before d {pause} saying "" yes , meetings have a lot of overlaps "" is to actually find out how many more {pause} we have than two - party . Postdoc F : I think so too , I think {disfmarker} PhD B : Cuz in two - party conversations , like Switchboard , there 's an awful lot too if you just look at backchannels , if you consider those overlaps ? it 's also ver it 's huge . It 's just that people haven't been {pause} looking at that because they 've been doing single - channel processing for {pause} speech recognition . Grad H : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Mm - hmm ? PhD B : So , the question is , you know , how many more overlaps {pause} {vocalsound} do you have {pause} of , say the two - person type , by adding more people . to a meeting , and it may be a lot more but i it may {disfmarker} {pause} it may not be . Professor D : Well , but see , I find it interesting even if it wasn't any more , PhD B : So . Professor D : because {pause} since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in Switchboard where it was just all separated out {vocalsound} we just {disfmarker} everything was just nice , PhD B : Mm - hmm ? Professor D : so that {disfmarker} so the issue is in {disfmarker} in a situation {pause} where th that 's {disfmarker} PhD B : Well , it 's not really {pause} "" nice "" . It depends what you 're doing . So if you were actually {pause} {vocalsound} having , uh {disfmarker} depends what you 're doing , if {disfmarker} Right now we 're do we have individual mikes on the people in this meeting . So the question is , you know {disfmarker} "" are there really more overlaps happening than there would be in a two - person {pause} party "" . Professor D : Mm - hmm ? PhD B : And {disfmarker} and there well may be , but {disfmarker} Professor D : Let {disfmarker} let m let me rephrase what I 'm saying cuz I don't think I 'm getting it across . What {disfmarker} what I {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} I shouldn't use words like "" nice "" because maybe that 's too {disfmarker} i too imprecise . But what I mean is {vocalsound} that , um in Switchboard , {pause} despite the many {disfmarker} many other problems that we have , one problem that we 're not considering is overlap . And what we 're doing now is , {pause} aside from the many other differences in the task , we are considering overlap and one of the reasons that we 're considering it , {pause} you know , one of them not all of them , one of them is {vocalsound} that w uh at least , {pause} you know I 'm very interested in {vocalsound} the scenario in which , uh {pause} both people talking are pretty much equally {pause} audible , {vocalsound} and from a single microphone . And so , {pause} in that case , it does get mixed in , {vocalsound} and it 's pretty hard to jus {pause} to just ignore it , to just do processing on one and not on the other . PhD B : I {disfmarker} I agree that it 's an issue here {pause} but it 's also an issue for Switchboard and if you {pause} think of meetings {pause} being recorded over the telephone , which I think , you know , this whole point of studying meetings isn't just to have people in a room but to also have {pause} meetings over different phone lines . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Maybe far field mike people wouldn't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : so if each of us was calling and having {pause} {vocalsound} a meeting that way {pause} you kn you know like a conference call . And , just the question is , {pause} y you know , in Switchboard {pause} you would think that 's the simplest case of a meeting of more than one person , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and {pause} {vocalsound} I 'm wondering how much more {pause} overlap {pause} of {pause} the types that {disfmarker} that Jane described happen with more people present . So it may be that having three people {pause} {vocalsound} is very different from having two people or it may not be . Professor D : That 's an important question to ask . PhD B : So . Professor D : I think what I 'm {disfmarker} {pause} All I 'm s really saying is that I don't think we were considering that in Switchboard . PhD B : Not you , me . But uh {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but Professor D : Were you ? Grad H : Though it wasn't {pause} in the design . Professor D : Were you {disfmarker} were you {disfmarker} were you {disfmarker} were you measuring it ? I mean , w w were {disfmarker} PhD B : There {disfmarker} there 's actually to tell you the truth , the reason why it 's hard to measure is because of so , from the point of view of studying dialogue , I mean , which {pause} Dan Jurafsky and Andreas and I had some projects on , you want to know the sequence of turns . Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : So what happens is if you 're talking and I have a backchannel in the middle of your turn , and then you keep going what it looks like in a dialogue model is your turn and then my backchannel , Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn . Professor D : Yeah ? PhD B : So , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling {pause} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} We know that that 's wrong in real time . Professor D : Yeah ? PhD B : But , because of the acoustic segmentations that were done and the fact that some of the acoustic data in Switchboard were missing , people couldn't study it , but that doesn't mean in the real world that people don't talk that way . So , it 's {disfmarker} um Professor D : Yeah , I wasn't saying that . Right ? I was just saying that w now we 're looking at it . PhD B : Well , we 've als Professor D : And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , you {disfmarker} you maybe wanted to look at it before but , for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you weren't . PhD B : Right . We 're looking at it here . Professor D : So that 's why it 's coming to us as new even though it may well be {pause} you know , if your {disfmarker} if your hypothes The hypothesis you were offering {vocalsound} eh {disfmarker} PhD B : Um . Professor D : Right ? {disfmarker} if it 's the null poth {comment} hypothesis , and if actually you have as much overlap in a two - person , {vocalsound} we don't know the answer to that . The reason we don't know the answer to is cuz it wasn't studied and it wasn't studied because it wasn't set up . Right ? PhD B : Yeah , all I meant is that if you 're asking the question from the point of view of {pause} what 's different about a meeting , studying meetings of , say , more than two people versus {pause} what kinds of questions you could ask with a two - person {pause} meeting . Professor D : Mm - hmm ? PhD B : It 's important to distinguish {pause} that , you know , this project {pause} is getting a lot of overlap {pause} but other projects were too , but we just couldn't study them . And and so uh Professor D : May have been . May have been . Right ? PhD B : Well , there is a high rate , Professor D : We do kn we don't know the numbers . PhD B : So . It 's {disfmarker} but I don't know how high , in fact PhD A : Well , here I have a question . PhD B : that would be interesting to know . Professor D : See , I mean , i i le let me t I mean , my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , "" what have we learned about overlaps here ? "" just never mind comparison with something else , PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : what we 've learned about is overlaps in this situation , is that {disfmarker} the first {disfmarker} {pause} the first - order thing I would say is that there 's a lot of them . Right ? PhD E : Yeah . Professor D : In {disfmarker} in the sense that i if you said if {disfmarker} i i i PhD B : Yeah , I {disfmarker} I don't di I agree with that . Professor D : In a way , I guess what I 'm comparing to is more the common sense notion of {vocalsound} how {disfmarker} how much people overlap . Uh {pause} you know the fact that when {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when , uh , Adam was looking for a stretch of {disfmarker} of speech before , that didn't have any overlaps , and he w he was having such a hard time and now I look at this and I go , "" well , I can see why he was having such a hard time "" . PhD B : Right . That 's also true of Switchboard . Professor D : It 's happening a lot . PhD B : It may not be {disfmarker} Professor D : I wasn't saying it wasn't . PhD B : Right . So it 's just , um Professor D : Right ? I was commenting about this . PhD B : OK . All I 'm saying is that from the Professor D : I 'm saying if I {disfmarker} {pause} I 'm saying if I have this complicated thing in front of me , {vocalsound} and we sh which , {pause} you know we 're gonna get much more sophisticated about when we get lots more data , But {disfmarker} Then , if I was gonna describe to somebody what did you learn {pause} right here , about , you know , the {disfmarker} the modest amount of data that was analyzed I 'd say , "" Well , the first - order thing was there was a lot of overlaps "" . In fact {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and it 's not just an overlap {disfmarker} bunch of overlaps {disfmarker} second - order thing is {vocalsound} it 's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point , {vocalsound} but that there 's overlaps , uh throughout the thing . Grad H : Right . PhD B : Right . No , I {disfmarker} I agree with that . Professor D : And that 's interesting . That 's all . PhD B : I 'm just {pause} {vocalsound} saying that it may {disfmarker} {pause} the reason you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the number of people in the meeting . Professor D : Oh yeah . PhD B : And that 's all . Professor D : Yeah . Yeah , I wasn't making any statement about that . PhD B : And {disfmarker} and it would actually be interesting to find out Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : because some of the data say Switchboard , which isn't exactly the same kind of context , I mean these are two people who don't know each other and so forth , But we should still be able to somehow say what {disfmarker} what is the added contra contribution to sort of overlap time of each additional person , or something like that .","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions. The questions should be diverse and should ask about different aspects related to the document. No two questions should be asking about the same thing and each question should be a wh-question. Do not provide anything else other than generated questions separaterd by commas. Document: Postdoc F : OK, it's {disfmarker} it's very {pause} eh {disfmarker} it's {pause} very brief, I mean {disfmarker} just let me {disfmarker} just hand these out. Oops. Grad H : Is this the same as the email or different? PhD C : Thanks. Postdoc F : It's slightly different. I {disfmarker} {pause} basically the same. Grad H : OK. PhD A : Same idea? Postdoc F : But, same idea. So, if you've looked at this you've seen it before, so {pause} Basically, {vocalsound} um {pause} as you know, uh {pause} part of the encoding {pause} includes a mark that indicates {pause} an overlap. It's not indicated {pause} with, um {pause} uh, tight precision, it's just indicated that {disfmarker} OK, so, It's indicated to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} so the people know {pause} what parts of sp which {disfmarker} which stretches of speech were in the clear, versus being overlapped by others. So, I {pause} used this mark and, um {pause} and, uh {pause} uh, {pause} divided the {disfmarker} I wrote a script {pause} which divides things into individual minutes, {pause} of which we ended up with forty {pause} five, and a little bit. And, uh {pause} you know, minute zero, of course, is the first minute up to {pause} sixty seconds. PhD C : OK. Postdoc F : And, um {pause} What you can see is the number of overlaps {pause} and then {pause} to the right, {pause} whether they involve two speakers, three speakers, or more than three speakers. And, {pause} um {pause} and, what I was looking for sp sp specifically was the question of {pause} whether they're distributed evenly throughout or whether they're {pause} bursts of them. Um. And {pause} it looked to me as though {disfmarker} uh, you know {disfmarker} y this is just {disfmarker} {pause} eh {disfmarker} eh, this would {disfmarker} this is not statistically {pause} verified, {pause} but it {pause} did look to me as though there are bursts throughout, rather than being {pause} localized to a particular region. The part down there, where there's the maximum number of {disfmarker} {pause} of, um {pause} overlaps is an area where we were discussing {pause} {vocalsound} whether or not it would be useful to indi to s to {pause} code {pause} stress, {pause} uh, sentence stress {pause} as possible indication of, uh {pause} information retrieval. So it's like, {pause} you know, rather, {pause} lively discussion there. Professor D : What was {disfmarker} what's the {disfmarker} the parenthesized stuff {pause} that says, like {disfmarker} e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight? Postdoc F : Oh, th {vocalsound} {pause} That's the per cent. Professor D : Mmm. Postdoc F : So, six is, uh {pause} two point eight percent {pause} of the total number of overlaps in the {pause} session. PhD E : Mm - hmm. Professor D : Ah. PhD C : Mm - hmm. Postdoc F : At the very end, this is when people were, {pause} you know, packing up to go basically, there's {pause} this final stuff, I think we {disfmarker} {pause} I don't remember where the digits {pause} fell. I 'd have to look at that. But {pause} the final three there are no overlaps at all. And {pause} couple times there {pause} are not. PhD E : Mm - hmm. Postdoc F : So, i it seems like it goes through bursts {pause} but, um {pause} that's kind of it. PhD E : Mm - hmm. Postdoc F : Now, {pause} Another question is {pause} is there {disfmarker} are there {pause} individual differences in whether you're likely to be overlapped with or to overlap with others. And, again {pause} I want to emphasize this is just one {pause} particular {pause} um {disfmarker} {pause} one particular meeting, and also there's been no statistical testing of it all, but {pause} I, um {pause} I took the coding of {pause} the {disfmarker} I, you know, my {disfmarker} I had this script {pause} figure out, um {pause} who {pause} was the first speaker, who was the second speaker involved in a two - person overlap, I didn't look at the ones involving three or more. And, um {pause} {pause} this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of {pause} who tended to be overlapping most often with who {disfmarker} who else, and {pause} if you look at the marginal totals, which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom, you get {pause} the totals for an individual. So, {vocalsound} um {pause} If you {pause} look at the bottom, those are the, um {pause} numbers of overlaps in which {pause} um {pause} Adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look {disfmarker} I'm sorry, but you're o alphabetical, that's why I'm choosing you And then if you look across the right, {pause} then {pause} that's where he was the {pause} person who was the sp first speaker in the pair {pause} and got overlap overlapped with by somebody. PhD A : Hmm! PhD E : Mm - hmm. Postdoc F : And, {pause} then if you look down in the summary table, {pause} then you see that, um {pause} th they're differences in {pause} whether a person got overlapped with or {pause} overlapped by. Grad H : Is this uh {pause} just raw counts or is it {disfmarker} Postdoc F : Raw counts. Grad H : So it would be interesting to see how much each person spoke. PhD B : Mm - hmm. PhD C : Yeah. PhD E : Yeah {vocalsound} Yeah Postdoc F : Yes, very true {disfmarker} very true Grad H : Normalized to how much {disfmarker} Postdoc F : it would be good to normalize with respect to that. Now on the table I did {pause} take one step toward, uh {pause} away from the raw frequencies by putting, {pause} uh {pause} percentages. So that the percentage of time {pause} of the {disfmarker} of the times that a person spoke, {pause} what percentage {pause} eh, w so. Of the times a person spoke and furthermore was involved in a two two - person overlap, {vocalsound} {vocalsound} what percentage of the time were they the overlapper and what percent of the time were they th the overlappee? And there, it looks like you see some differences, um, {pause} that some people tend to be overlapped {pause} with more often than they're overlapped, but, of course, uh i e {vocalsound} this is just one meeting, {pause} uh {pause} there's no statistical testing involved, and that would be {pause} required for a {disfmarker} for a finding {pause} of {pause} any {pause} kind of {pause} scientific {pause} reliability. Professor D : S so, i it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something. Grad H : No {disfmarker} no actually, that would be actually statistically correct, Professor D : Yeah, yeah. Postdoc F : No, no, no. PhD E : Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Grad H : but Postdoc F : Yeah, that's right. Professor D : Yeah. Excuse me. Postdoc F : That's right. And I'm {pause} you know, I'm {disfmarker} I don't see a point of singling people out, Professor D : B I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I rather enjoyed it, but {disfmarker} but this Postdoc F : now, this is a case where obviously {disfmarker} PhD A : But the numbers speak for themselves. PhD E : He's {disfmarker} Yeah, yeah, yeah. Postdoc F : Well, {vocalsound} you know, it's like {disfmarker} I'm not {disfmarker} I'm not saying on the tape who did {pause} better or worse Grad H : Yes, that's right, so you don't nee OK. Professor D : Sure. Postdoc F : because {pause} I don't think that it's {disfmarker} I {pause} you know, and {disfmarker} and th here's a case where of course, human subjects people would say be sure that you anonymize the results, {pause} and {disfmarker} and, so, might as well do this. Professor D : Yeah. Grad H : Yeah, when {disfmarker} this is what {disfmarker} This is actually {disfmarker} when Jane sent this email first, is what caused me to start thinking about anonymizing the data. Postdoc F : Well, fair enough. Fair enough. Professor D : Yeah. Postdoc F : And actually, {pause} you know, the point is not about an individual, it's the point about {pause} tendencies toward {pause} you know, different styles, different speaker styles. Professor D : Oh sure. Postdoc F : And {pause} it would be, you know {pause} of course, {pause} there's also the question of what type of overlap was this, and w what were they, and i and I {disfmarker} and I know that I can distinguish at least three types and, probably more, I mean, the {vocalsound} general {pause} {vocalsound} cultural idea which w uh, the conversation analysts originally started with in the seventies was that we have this {vocalsound} strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th before you start talking, and {pause} and you know, I mean, {pause} w we know that {disfmarker} {pause} an and they've loosened up on that too s in the intervening time, that {pause} that that's {disfmarker} that's viewed as being {pause} a culturally - relative thing, I mean, {pause} that you have the high - involvement style from the East Coast where people {vocalsound} will overlap often as an indication of interest in what the other person is saying. And Grad H : Uh - huh. PhD B : Exactly! Postdoc F : Yeah, exactly! PhD E : Yeah Postdoc F : Well, there you go. Fine, that's alright, that's OK. And {disfmarker} and, {pause} you know, in contrast, so Deborah {disfmarker} d and also Deborah Tannen's {pause} thesis she talked about differences of these types, {pause} that they're just different styles, and it's um {pause} you {disfmarker} you can't impose a model of {disfmarker} {pause} there {disfmarker} of the ideal being no overlaps, and {pause} you know, conversational analysts also agree with that, so it's {pause} now, universally {pause} a ag agreed with. And {disfmarker} and, als I mean, I can't say universally, but anyway, the people who used to say it was strict, {pause} um {pause} now, uh {pause} don't. I mean they {disfmarker} they {pause} also {pause} {vocalsound} you know, uh {pause} uh, ack acknowledge the influence of {pause} sub of subcultural norms and {pause} cross - cultural norms and things. So, um Then it beco {pause} though {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just superficially to give {pause} um {pause} a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved, I have at the bottom several that I noticed. So, {pause} {vocalsound} uh, there are backchannels, like what Adam just did now and, um {pause} {vocalsound} um, anticipating the end of a question and {pause} simply answering it earlier, and there are several of those in this {disfmarker} in these data where {disfmarker} PhD B : Mm - hmm. Postdoc F : because we're {pause} people who've talked to each other, um {pause} we know {pause} basically what the topic is, what the possibilities are and w and we've spoken with each other so we know basically what the other person's style is likely to be and so {vocalsound} and t there are a number of places where someone just answered early. No problem. And places {pause} also which I thought were interesting, where two or more people gave exactly th the same answer in unison {disfmarker} different words of course but you know, the {disfmarker} basically, {pause} you know everyone's saying "" yes "" or {disfmarker} you know, or ev even more sp specific than that. So, uh, the point is that, um {pause} {vocalsound} overlap's not necessarily a bad thing and that it would be im {pause} i useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved. And that's all I wanted to say on that, {pause} unless people have questions. Professor D : Well, of course th the biggest, {pause} um {pause} result here, which is one we've {disfmarker} {pause} we've talked about many times and isn't new to us, but which I think would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this {vocalsound} {pause} is just the sheer number of overlaps. Grad H : Yep. Professor D : That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Right? {pause} that {disfmarker} that, um PhD E : Yes, yes! Postdoc F : Oh, OK {disfmarker} interesting. PhD E : Yeah. Professor D : here's a relatively short meeting, it's a forty {disfmarker} {pause} forty plus minute {pause} {vocalsound} meeting, and not only were there two hundred and fifteen overlaps {vocalsound} {pause} but, {pause} uh I think there's one {disfmarker} {pause} one minute there where there {disfmarker} where {disfmarker} where there wasn't any overlap? Grad H : Hundred ninety - seven. Professor D : I mean, it's {disfmarker} {pause} {vocalsound} uh throughout this thing? PhD A : It 'd be interesting {disfmarker} Professor D : It's {disfmarker} You have {disfmarker} Postdoc F : Well, at the bottom, you have the bottom three. PhD E : Yeah.

So this is the {disfmarker} another line {disfmarker} another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE Professor D : Ah , yes . Mm - hmm . PhD A : and {pause} uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh {disfmarker} the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well . Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps {disfmarker} well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal . The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs . And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs . Um , yeah . Mmm . You know you can {disfmarker} you can comment these results , PhD B : Yes , I can s I would like to say that , for example , um , mmm , if we doesn't use the delta - delta , uh we have an improve when we use s some combination . But when PhD A : Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy . PhD B : w Yeah , this {disfmarker} Yeah , this number recognition acc PhD A : So it 's not the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Again we switch to another {disfmarker} PhD B : Yes , and the baseline {disfmarker} the baseline have {disfmarker} i is eighty - two . Professor D : Baseline is eighty - two . PhD B : Yeah PhD A : So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this . Professor D : Uh , this is Italian mismatched . PhD A : Um . PhD B : Yeah , by the moment . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : OK . PhD B : And first in the experiment - one I {disfmarker} I do {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I use different MLP , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better . Um . for the ne {disfmarker} rest of experiment I use multi - English , only multi - English . And I try to combine different type of feature , but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy . PhD A : Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , the huge table , um , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : but this is not the case for Italian what {disfmarker} where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : So , um {vocalsound} uh , well , I don't think this is a bug but this {disfmarker} this is something in {disfmarker} probably in the MSG um process that uh I don't know what exactly . Perhaps the fact that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} there 's no low - pass filter , well , or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian , or , well , something simple like that . But {disfmarker} that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP . Professor D : I Um , the uh , baseline system {disfmarker} when you said the baseline system was uh , uh eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? That was , uh Italian mismatched d uh , uh , digits , uh , is the testing , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : and the training is Italian digits ? PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : So the "" mismatch "" just refers to the noise and {disfmarker} and , uh microphone and so forth , PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : right ? So , um did we have {disfmarker} So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is {disfmarker} is the uh Italian digits ? PhD B : The train the training of the HTK ? Professor D : The {disfmarker} PhD B : Yes . Ah yes ! Professor D : Yes . PhD B : This h Yes . Th - Yes . Professor D : Yes . Training of the net , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : yeah . So , um {disfmarker} So what that says is that in a matched condition , {vocalsound} we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP . Now w would {disfmarker} do we have a number , I suppose for the matched {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't mean matched , but uh use of Italian {disfmarker} training in Italian digits for PLP only ? PhD B : Uh {pause} yes ? PhD A : Uh {pause} yeah , so this is {disfmarker} basically this is in the table . Uh {pause} so the number is fifty - two , PhD B : Another table . PhD A : uh {disfmarker} Professor D : Fifty - two percent . PhD A : Fift - So {disfmarker} No , it 's {disfmarker} it 's the {disfmarker} PhD B : No . Professor D : No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ? PhD A : Of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of uh {pause} eighteen {disfmarker} PhD B : Eighty . PhD A : of eighteen . PhD B : Eighty . PhD A : So it 's {disfmarker} it 's error rate , basically . PhD B : It 's plus six . PhD A : It 's er error rate ratio . So {disfmarker}  Professor D : Oh this is accuracy !  PhD A : Uh , so we have nine {disfmarker} nine {disfmarker} let 's say ninety percent . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Oy ! {comment} OK . Ninety . PhD A : Yeah . Um {comment} which is uh {comment} what we have also if use PLP and MSG together , Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : eighty - nine point seven . Professor D : OK , so even just PLP , uh , it is not , in the matched condition {disfmarker} Um I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping . PhD A : Uh . P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same {disfmarker} same results . Professor D : Same result pretty much ? PhD A : Well , we have these results . I don't know . It 's not {disfmarker} Do you have this result with PLP alone , {comment} j fee feeding HTK ? Professor D : So , s PhD A : That {disfmarker} That 's what you mean ? PhD B : Yeah , PhD A : Just PLP at the input of HTK . PhD B : yeah yeah yeah yeah , at the first {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . So , PLP {disfmarker} Professor D : Eighty - eight point six . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Um , so adding MSG PhD A : Um {disfmarker} Professor D : um {disfmarker} Well , but that 's {disfmarker} yeah , that 's without the neural net , PhD A : Yeah , that 's without the neural net Professor D : right ? PhD A : and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization . Professor D : But she had said eighty - two . PhD A : This is the {disfmarker} w well , but this is without on - line normalization . Professor D : Right ? Oh , this {disfmarker} the eighty - two . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B :  PhD A : Eighty - two is the {disfmarker} it 's the Aurora baseline , so MFCC . Then we can use {disfmarker} well , OGI , they use MFCC {disfmarker} th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization Professor D : Oh , I 'm sorry , I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy . PhD A : Yeah , sorry . Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . Alright . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Alright . So this is {disfmarker} I was thinking all this was worse . OK so this is all better PhD B : Yes , better . Professor D : because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm all better now . OK , go ahead . PhD A : So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent . Professor D : Yeah . Mm - hmm . PhD A : Uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same . We j jump to ninety percent . PhD B : Nnn , we don't know exactly . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : And {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} whatever the normalization , actually . If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . So {disfmarker} Professor D : So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to {disfmarker} to ninety , or something .

PhD A : So, um {vocalsound} uh, well, I don't think this is a bug but this {disfmarker} this is something in {disfmarker} probably in the MSG um process that uh I don't know what exactly. Perhaps the fact that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} there's no low - pass filter, well, or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian, or, well, something simple like that. But {disfmarker} that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information. Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : And as Carmen said, if we combine the two, we have the result, basically, of PLP. Professor D : I Um, the uh, baseline system {disfmarker} when you said the baseline system was uh, uh eighty - two percent, that was trained on what and tested on what? That was, uh Italian mismatched d uh, uh, digits, uh, is the testing, PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : and the training is Italian digits? PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : So the "" mismatch "" just refers to the noise and {disfmarker} and, uh microphone and so forth, PhD A : Yeah. PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : right? So, um did we have {disfmarker} So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is {disfmarker} is the uh Italian digits? PhD B : The train the training of the HTK? Professor D : The {disfmarker} PhD B : Yes. Ah yes! Professor D : Yes. PhD B : This h Yes. Th - Yes. Professor D : Yes. Training of the net, PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : yeah. So, um {disfmarker} So what that says is that in a matched condition, {vocalsound} we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP. Now w would {disfmarker} do we have a number, I suppose for the matched {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't mean matched, but uh use of Italian {disfmarker} training in Italian digits for PLP only? PhD B : Uh {pause} yes? PhD A : Uh {pause} yeah, so this is {disfmarker} basically this is in the table. Uh {pause} so the number is fifty - two, PhD B : Another table. PhD A : uh {disfmarker} Professor D : Fifty - two percent. PhD A : Fift - So {disfmarker} No, it's {disfmarker} it's the {disfmarker} PhD B : No. Professor D : No, fifty - two percent of eighty - two? PhD A : Of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of uh {pause} eighteen {disfmarker} PhD B : Eighty. PhD A : of eighteen. PhD B : Eighty. PhD A : So it's {disfmarker} it's error rate, basically. PhD B : It's plus six. PhD A : It's er error rate ratio. So {disfmarker}  Professor D : Oh this is accuracy!  PhD A : Uh, so we have nine {disfmarker} nine {disfmarker} let's say ninety percent. PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : Oy! {comment} OK. Ninety. PhD A : Yeah. Um {comment} which is uh {comment} what we have also if use PLP and MSG together, Professor D : Yeah. PhD A : eighty - nine point seven. Professor D : OK, so even just PLP, uh, it is not, in the matched condition {disfmarker} Um I wonder if it's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra, or whether it's that the net half, for some reason, is not helping. PhD A : Uh. P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same {disfmarker} same results. Professor D : Same result pretty much? PhD A : Well, we have these results. I don't know. It's not {disfmarker} Do you have this result with PLP alone, {comment} j fee feeding HTK? Professor D : So, s PhD A : That {disfmarker} That's what you mean? PhD B : Yeah, PhD A : Just PLP at the input of HTK. PhD B : yeah yeah yeah yeah, at the first {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} Yeah. PhD A : Yeah. So, PLP {disfmarker} Professor D : Eighty - eight point six. PhD A : Yeah. Professor D : Um, so adding MSG PhD A : Um {disfmarker} Professor D : um {disfmarker} Well, but that's {disfmarker} yeah, that's without the neural net, PhD A : Yeah, that's without the neural net Professor D : right? PhD A : and that's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization. Professor D : But she had said eighty - two. PhD A : This is the {disfmarker} w well, but this is without on - line normalization. Professor D : Right? Oh, this {disfmarker} the eighty - two. PhD A : Yeah. PhD B :  PhD A : Eighty - two is the {disfmarker} it's the Aurora baseline, so MFCC. Then we can use {disfmarker} well, OGI, they use MFCC {disfmarker} th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization Professor D : Oh, I'm sorry, I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy. PhD A : Yeah, sorry. Yeah. PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : OK. Alright. PhD A : Yeah. Professor D : Alright. So this is {disfmarker} I was thinking all this was worse. OK so this is all better PhD B : Yes, better. Professor D : because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two. PhD A : Mm - hmm. PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : OK. I'm {disfmarker} I'm all better now. OK, go ahead. PhD A : So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent. Professor D : Yeah. Mm - hmm. PhD A : Uh, when we apply a neural network, is the same. We j jump to ninety percent. PhD B : Nnn, we don't know exactly. Professor D : Yeah. PhD A : And {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} whatever the normalization, actually. If we use n neural network, even if the features are not correctly normalized, we jump to ninety percent. So {disfmarker} Professor D : So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to {disfmarker} to ninety, or something. PhD A : Well, ninety {disfmarker} No, I {disfmarker} I mean ninety It's around eighty - nine, ninety, eighty - eight. Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"

752,"The Chair : We'll now go to Ms. Kwan. Ms. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. Instead of providing a universal direct payment for all, the government has decided to implement a complicated program that leaves many people behind. A single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19. She pays taxes on her spousal income, but she is not eligible for CERB. The Minister of Employment said that she is looking into this gap. It has been weeks, and still no action. Will the Prime Minister step in and fix this gap so that the single parents and their children can get the support they need during this pandemic? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : I'm happy, Mr. Chair, to correct the honourable member by pointing out that we actually moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit. However, as the member points out, when one moves quickly and efficiently, there will be gaps, and that's why we've been working diligently to try to fill those gaps. We want to make sure that Canadians who need help, get it. Ms. Jenny Kwan : While the Minister of Employment has been aware of this for three weeks and says she is looking into it, there's still been no action. The truth of the matter is that single parents and their children who depend on spousal support and child maintenance are not getting support. Will the Prime Minister fix this gap? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : We recognize the particular challenge faced by families, single parents and families with young children, which is why we increased the amount of the Canada child benefit to be able to support people in this particular moment. On top of that, we have looked to fill further gaps that have existed with the Canada emergency response benefit. Well over seven million Canadians have access to CERB, and we will continue to work with them Ms. Jenny Kwan : That does not replace spousal support and child maintenance, Prime Minister. Across the country there is no national standard to address the homelessness crisis amidst this pandemic, leaving communities at heightened risk from COVID-19. Canadians who are homeless or living in substandard housing have no access to bathroom facilities for basic hygiene. Those living in crowded SROs and shelters cannot practise social distancing. The problem is particularly acute in my riding in the Downtown Eastside. While the B.C. government has implemented an initiative to house some of the homeless population in empty hotels in the short term, support from the federal government is needed to secure permanent solutions post-COVID-19. Will the Prime Minister commit to providing matching funds and take the right to adequate housing seriously? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : I know that the honourable member wouldn't want to inadvertently mislead the House. The fact is, the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources, hundreds of millions of dollars, to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities, including renting new spaces, to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of COVID-19. I recognize there's always more to do, but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy, we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable Canadians, and we will continue to do that. Ms. Jenny Kwan : The Prime Minister must know that the money the federal government sent is deficient. Many people still remain homeless, and they are at risk. Cutting chronic homelessness by 50% over the next decade is not good enough, and that is this Prime Minister's national housing strategy. Will the government stop just making empty promises and ensure that every Canadian has the right to housing? Will he top up the support for provinces to at least match their funds? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, cutting chronic homelessness by 50% is an ambitious goal that no one else has ever been able to do as a government, and we are well on track for it. I would suggest that the member opposite not dismiss that as an empty promise, because we have demonstrated actions on it. I recognize there is more to do. There is always more to do. We will be there and continue to be there for vulnerable people, including homeless Canadians. Ms. Jenny Kwan : I would remind the Prime Minister that it was the federal Liberals who eliminated the national affordable housing program in 1993, so we have this homeless crisis today as a result of the Liberals. We in Vancouver East have the third-largest urban indigenous population in the country, yet we got less than 2% of the pandemic urban indigenous housing funding. They're overrepresented among the homeless population. Why? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr. Chair, we recognize there is more to do in supporting urban indigenous people. We have moved forward, both through the Minister of Indigenous Services and the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, to address the challenges facing urban aboriginal populations. We will continue to work with them, recognizing that they are among the most vulnerable people in Canada who deserve the right support from all orders of government, and we will be there to support them increasingly in the coming years.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

I don't think the cost is justified {vocalsound} for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and I don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah I think we have {disfmarker} like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : 'cause it's it it breaks down easier . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that . Project Manager : But then that that surely d depends a little on the T_V_ Marketing : W Project Manager : because some T_V_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so {disfmarker} User Interface : Sure . Project Manager : if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the T_V_'s ability to to change channels . Or do you have to go through and you wait for it ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : {vocalsound} You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to {disfmarker} User Interface : Well I think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it's maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it's where it's quantized into you know certain {disfmarker} Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh yeah . Project Manager : Uh I see I see . That's where you {disfmarker} User Interface : That was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Ah I see I see what you're talking about now . Okay . Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : It's just {disfmarker} it's basically {disfmarker} it it's just a f look and feel thing . It has the same exact functionality as two buttons . Marketing : {vocalsound} I I think there's {disfmarker} you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing {disfmarker} are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . Project Manager : Yeah if you're just sitting there going {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Marketing : Instead of going button-to-bu you just {vocalsound} j you'd j j j j j j . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : That's kinda cool actually . Marketing : I really I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing . Project Manager : I like that . User Interface : Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip . Marketing : Well there's ano Project Manager : Well not n necessarily . User Interface : But {disfmarker} Project Manager : You could basically make it so that it'll {disfmarker} I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once . User Interface : Right . Marketing : That's right . Project Manager : If you do that . User Interface : Yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , Project Manager : Other than click click click . Yeah . User Interface : but I think once people get used to it {disfmarker} I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though . Project Manager : And if we're marketing it as a high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good T_V_s as well , yeah , presumably . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Primarily . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah I think so . I I think so . Industrial Designer : Yep . Marketing : Now the the only thing I I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} on the interface side of it , is that {vocalsound} I I I see the dilemma . {vocalsound} But if we have the option of of scrolling {vocalsound} at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . Project Manager : Mm-hmm .

Marketing : Yeah wh wh what's the {vocalsound} wh User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah. Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm 'kay Industrial Designer : But would we {disfmarker} Marketing : Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons. So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique. Project Manager : Yeah. Marketing : If it creates something more complex or more expensive, then I don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity. But again, from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co {vocalsound} it's a very competitive market. Project Manager : What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make. User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : So I d User Interface : Th they are gonna be more expensive, but on the other hand, I mean, it {disfmarker} I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know {disfmarker} if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it, but I mean I would just use {disfmarker} if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down.

Project Manager : {gap} Marketing : {vocalsound} Okay . Project Manager : Should stay in the square here . {vocalsound} Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Oh , maybe . Marketing : Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . Project Manager : Oh , you can put it here . Oh that's okay , it's jus Marketing : Um so first of all we {disfmarker} what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . Um they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . Completely ugly . Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ . Um , that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it . Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most {disfmarker} by far the most used buttons on the remote control . Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching T_V_ . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : Um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . And basically they came {disfmarker} they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . Um and the audio and picture settings had a very {disfmarker} that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well . {vocalsound} So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . Um {vocalsound} they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . Um and then thirdly , they {disfmarker} some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury . {vocalsound} We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the {disfmarker} on the remote control . In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . They want these features , they want these high technology features . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features .

Project Manager : {gap} Industrial Designer : Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Don't you say that you cannot do double shape {disfmarker} uh curved shape {disfmarker} User Interface : But {disfmarker} Doub double-curved. Industrial Designer : yeah it's it's Marketing : Mm. Seems to be {gap}. Project Manager : yeah. Industrial Designer : yeah that's a {disfmarker} we're to look for {gap} Project Manager : Mm-hmm. Okay. Industrial Designer : and and s we're to see the {disfmarker} whether rubber is expensive User Interface : Okay, okay. In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the {disfmarker} like titanium panels on a whole rubber body. Industrial Designer : and d Hmm. Project Manager : Mm-mm. Okay, so User Interface : Well, okay w we'll see. Project Manager : you explore now that you're going to work together these these two. User Interface : Yeah Industrial Designer : Mm. Project Manager : Or or spongy an yeah. {gap} Industrial Designer : Yeah. Maybe we can have two different {gap} assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium. Project Manager : Mm. Industrial Designer : {gap} we have only the plastic or the {disfmarker} the chippy {disfmarker} yeah fibre chips or {disfmarker} User Interface : We'll see. We'll see. Marketing : If you have time. Project Manager : Mm. Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose. If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy Industrial Designer : Uh. Project Manager : but uh it cannot be both. User Interface : We'll see. I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some {gap} for for Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} For creation. User Interface : I dunno uh {disfmarker} yeah um Industrial Designer : Yeah. Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : we'll look. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Even design. {vocalsound} Marketing : You can paint it afterward {gap}. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : Okay, okay. Marketing : No problem. We have a very large department of {vocalsound} paint. Project Manager : Yeah, do don't worry, you you {vocalsound} you speak with {disfmarker} mm mm. Marketing : {vocalsound} You will do it. {vocalsound} User Interface : Alright, alright. Project Manager : Okay. So explore a shape. Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"

PhD D : I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't know what eh will {disfmarker} will happen with the {disfmarker} Grad G : Yep. PhD C : So. Grad G : That's a lot of overlap, PhD D : Yeah? Professor E : So again, that's {disfmarker} that's three {disfmarker} three hundred in forty - five minutes that are {disfmarker} that are speakers, just speakers. Grad G : yeah, for forty - five minutes. PhD D : Yeah. Yeah. Professor E : Uh - huh. OK. Yeah. Postdoc B : But a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a th Professor E : So that's about eight per minute. Postdoc B : But a thousand events in twelve minutes, that's {disfmarker} PhD D : Yeah, {pause} but {disfmarker} Yeah. PhD C : But that can include taps. PhD D : But {disfmarker} Professor E : Uh. Yeah. Postdoc B : Well, but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot. PhD D : General. PhD C : Actually {disfmarker} PhD D : I {disfmarker} I con I consider {disfmarker} I consider acoustic events eh, the silent too. Postdoc B : Silent. Grad G : Silence starting or silence ending {disfmarker} PhD D : Yeah, silent, ground to {disfmarker} bec to detect {disfmarker} eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech. PhD C : Oh, OK. Professor E : Mm - hmm. PhD A : Oh. PhD D : In ge in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in a general point of view. PhD C : Oh. Professor E : OK, so how many of those thousand were silence? PhD C : Alright. PhD D : in the per PhD F : Not speech {disfmarker} not speech or too much speech. PhD D : Too much speech. Professor E : Right. So how many of those thousand were silence, silent sections? PhD D : Yeah. Uh silent, I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I haven't the {disfmarker} eh I {disfmarker} I would like to {disfmarker} to do a stylistic study Professor E : Yeah.

885,"Project Manager : So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things . Industrial Designer : Okay , okay . Project Manager : So you you're {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Participant two . Yeah . Project Manager : Um . Okay . Marketing : {gap} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} The rationale must be {vocalsound} design , or {disfmarker} Project Manager : So , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . Okay . Industrial Designer : So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} I propose a nifra infrared base {vocalsound} you know , so so for me I think that it is better {vocalsound} it's bet it's better to control T_V_ Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know {disfmarker} For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to {disfmarker} Marketing : True . Project Manager : So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? Industrial Designer : I think it's cheaper than laser , so {vocalsound} . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Yeah . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen , Marketing : What the cost is ? Project Manager : yeah . The cost {disfmarker} Marketing : Twelve , twelve a half . Industrial Designer : Yeah , I think for the cost we want {disfmarker} for the cost we want {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it's better to have uh uh Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . Marketing : That might just {disfmarker} So . Industrial Designer : You can go to the next slide . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : I have some kind of pictures you know , here . You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . Project Manager : What is this ? Industrial Designer : This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and {gap} . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : So and the next slide , it is the last one it's {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I think it should be wire {vocalsound} wireless re remote con {vocalsound} Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ? Marketing : What's the average price of this technology then ? Industrial Designer : Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the User Interface : So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire {vocalsound} with remote control ? {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} You'd {disfmarker} yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : So you think that uh {vocalsound} a cable between the remote control {vocalsound} and the T_V_ {vocalsound} {disfmarker} won't be a good idea . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Okay . Okay . Project Manager : {vocalsound} No it wou maybe it will be cheaper {vocalsound} I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu Marketing : But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah , User Interface : {vocalsound} Wireless remote control {vocalsound} . Project Manager : but {disfmarker} Marketing : I don't think {disfmarker} well , yeah , I don't think he would , Industrial Designer : Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know , Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : but in a sense {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : sometime I want to have wire because you know . Project Manager : Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? Industrial Designer : {gap} {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ? Industrial Designer : Uh , {vocalsound} I don't {vocalsound} think it will be too much . User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Could you answer please ? {vocalsound} User Interface : Okay . Industrial Designer : Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's {disfmarker} I think that you know you can always you know {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . Project Manager : Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : The wire ? Project Manager : As it's {disfmarker} yeah . Marketing : Yeah . True . Industrial Designer : Okay , yeah . Project Manager : I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Uh that's my job . That's the {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay , {gap} I'm sorry . Marketing : Now the {disfmarker} Project Manager : So {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because {disfmarker} even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the {vocalsound} the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . Project Manager : {vocalsound} So User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : just think of um the usability . User Interface : Design a wireless remote control . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : I think it's would be easier to have {vocalsound} a link between the remote control and the television , Marketing : Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True . Project Manager : yeah . Marketing : This you will see in my presentation then . Marketing : So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : So this is from the experiments we've done , Project Manager : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Marketing : so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . Project Manager : {vocalsound} What is R_S_I_ ? Marketing : R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um {disfmarker} doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . Project Manager : Ah um okay . {vocalsound} Marketing : Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , User Interface : Functions . Marketing : this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : So {disfmarker} Project Manager : Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Sure ? Yeah ? User Interface : Yeah , I think possible . Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons . Project Manager : Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? User Interface : But I'm not sure {disfmarker} Project Manager : Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . Marketing : Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the Industrial Designer : The manuals . Project Manager : Yeah , Marketing : manual . Project Manager : I think the {disfmarker} Marketing : It's {disfmarker} User Interface : No you you can have a switch menu , so you can Project Manager : Yeah , but it has to be intuitive . User Interface : well for example {disfmarker} Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . Project Manager : Yeah , okay . Okay , User Interface : Then you you put the switch button , Project Manager : but {disfmarker} User Interface : then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder . Industrial Designer : With a {disfmarker} User Interface : So there's a different functions , but i if you you {disfmarker} there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . So we can has less buttons .

Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , {vocalsound} um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Oh {disfmarker} That's interesting . User Interface : Um it's not really speech recognition , it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that . Industrial Designer : Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah . Marketing : Oh okay . {gap} Project Manager : Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . Marketing : Right . User Interface : No it doesn't does not do anything . Marketing : No . Project Manager : Oh . That's a bit uh {disfmarker} User Interface : But i it's just a {disfmarker} Marketing : But that that makes it cheap . Project Manager : Yes . I understand . User Interface : Yeah it's it's cheap . Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} Marketing : It's {vocalsound} it's just a an extra function , Project Manager : But {vocalsound} it has no functionality for our remote at all .

User Interface : Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : They like gadgets . Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , ple Right . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : If it's cheap . Yeah . User Interface : Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and {gap} uh and that kind of stuff {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . Project Manager : So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ? User Interface : I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented . And uh I drew an example , Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do .

Marketing : For the {disfmarker} {gap} User Interface : This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : But how did {disfmarker} How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah . User Interface : Well we we can add another button here , but {disfmarker} Project Manager : Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works . Project Manager : Yes , well but bec because when you {vocalsound} push Menu you get in , Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Yeah ? Project Manager : and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . User Interface : Ah right . Well you you {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah . But you can men you can press menu again to get out . Project Manager : Well that's also the Okay button . That's you you should have uh {disfmarker} User Interface : No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button Industrial Designer : No . Project Manager : Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out . User Interface : and this the Okay button . Marketing : Exit . Project Manager : Exit {gap} . User Interface : Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option . Project Manager : Well , it's just a choice . User Interface : You have uh redundancy . Marketing : But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . User Interface : Yeah , Industrial Designer : {gap} Marketing : Or don't {disfmarker} User Interface : if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . Industrial Designer : Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? User Interface : Well they that could be anywhere . Industrial Designer : Where would you put it ? User Interface : That's very small . It could be uh down here . {vocalsound} Um . Well , not here . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . User Interface : I {vocalsound} yeah I suggest here . But that's just a little {vocalsound} gap . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Microphone , yeah . Marketing : Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something . User Interface : Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah I understand . Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . Marketing : {vocalsound} Alright . Industrial Designer : Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something . User Interface : Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they won't be uh very expensive . But {disfmarker} Project Manager : Huh ? Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : Yeah ? Okay . User Interface : This is my suggested design .","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

Do not provide anything else other than generated questions separaterd by commas. Document: User Interface : Yeah. Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier. Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented. Um we must decide where, this meeting. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems, {vocalsound} um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines. And um well they're cheap, so we could use them now. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Oh {disfmarker} That's interesting. User Interface : Um it's not really speech recognition, it's more um like you can um talk to the chip, uh record the message and record an answer, and then once you uh talk to the remote, then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left. So if I say hi Mike, and you have recorded uh hi Mike back, then you will get that. Industrial Designer : Oh, yeah, I understand. Yeah. Marketing : Oh okay. {gap} Project Manager : Okay. But you can also say that, when you say something, it does some function. Marketing : Right. User Interface : No it doesn't does not do anything. Marketing : No. Project Manager : Oh. That's a bit uh {disfmarker} User Interface : But i it's just a {disfmarker} Marketing : But that that makes it cheap. Project Manager : Yes. I understand. User Interface : Yeah it's it's cheap. Industrial Designer : Yeah. {vocalsound} Marketing : It's {vocalsound} it's just a an extra function, Project Manager : But {vocalsound} it has no functionality for our remote at all. Marketing : and it's cheap. User Interface : No Marketing : No but {vocalsound} {disfmarker} User Interface : but that's the gadget they want, or the gimmicks. Marketing : Yeah, right. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : But it it's n nice for young people. Marketing : Young people love them. User Interface : Yes, we we should really uh include that one, I think. Um {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : They like gadgets. Yeah. Marketing : Yeah, ple Right. Project Manager : Hmm. Industrial Designer : If it's cheap. Yeah. User Interface : Well, as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote. Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and {gap} uh and that kind of stuff {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen, uh instead of uh extra buttons. Project Manager : So you put a menu in the L_C_D_? User Interface : I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that. Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a, well, conventional remote, I think. For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable. A voice recognition can be uh implemented. And uh I drew an example, Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do. Marketing : {vocalsound} Alright. Industrial Designer : Can you draw it now of uh {disfmarker} Marketing : How {disfmarker} How {disfmarker} Project Manager : Ah. User Interface : Hmm? Well I have the {disfmarker} I can draw it again, Industrial Designer : Can you draw it now? User Interface : and I know what I did wrong. I didn't tick the note bo box in the {gap}. Um {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Mm. Alright. Marketing : How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen? User Interface : {vocalsound} Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the {disfmarker} Marketing : Alright. So you have a menu button, and then you can go up and down. Project Manager : But then we should also have an uh an Okay button. User Interface : Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen. Yes. Marketing : Yeah right. User Interface : {vocalsound} Um I shall draw this. If it uh works. Industrial Designer : {gap} button, yeah. Project Manager : Just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} There is already a blank. Yes? So {disfmarker} Yeah. Marketing : Yeah. {vocalsound} User Interface : Mm so have I. Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : Nah. Marketing : {gap}. {gap} You have to push hard. Project Manager : {vocalsound} {gap} Marketing : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : I suggest a banana shape.

User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yellow and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah alright, yeah. Just a hunch. {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct. Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course? User Interface : Yeah just uh the numbers. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : And then below is the L_C_D_ screen? User Interface : These these will be bigger in the the real design. Industrial Designer : {gap} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Alright, yeah. User Interface : This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen. Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm. User Interface : And with this you can uh, yes, go to through the menus Project Manager : Yeah. User Interface : and that can Um the video button should be uh an apart button, Marketing : You've {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yes.

Professor C : You wouldn't do like R - one over R - zero or something like that ? I mean usually for voiced - unvoiced you 'd do {disfmarker} yeah , you 'd do something {disfmarker} you 'd do energy PhD D : Yeah . Professor C : but then you have something like spectral slope , which is you get like R - one ov over R - zero or something like that . PhD D : Uh yeah . PhD E : What are the R 's ? Professor C : R correlations . PhD E : I 'm sorry I missed it . PhD D : No , R c No . PhD E : Oh . PhD D : Auto - correlation ? Yes , yes , the variance of the auto - correlation function that uses that Professor C : Ye - Well that 's the variance , but if you just say "" what is {disfmarker} "" I mean , to first order , um yeah one of the differences between voiced , unvoiced and silence is energy . Another one is {disfmarker} but the other one is the spectral shape . PhD D : Yeah , I I 'll {disfmarker} The spectral shape , Professor C : Yeah , and so R - one over R - zero is what you typically use for that . PhD D : yeah . No , I don't use that {disfmarker} I can't use {disfmarker} Professor C : No , I 'm saying that 's what people us typically use . PhD D : Mmm . Professor C : See , because it {disfmarker} because this is {disfmarker} this is just like a single number to tell you um "" does the spectrum look like that or does it look like that "" . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Grad A : Oh . R {disfmarker} R {disfmarker} R - zero . Professor C : Right ? PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : So if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's um {disfmarker} if it 's low energy uh but the {disfmarker} but the spectrum looks like that or like that , it 's probably silence . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Uh but if it 's low energy and the spectrum looks like that , it 's probably unvoiced . PhD D : Yeah . Professor C : So if you just {disfmarker} if you just had to pick two features to determine voiced - unvoiced , you 'd pick something about the spectrum like uh R - one over R - zero , um and R - zero PhD D : Mm - hmm , OK . Professor C : or i i you know you 'd have some other energy measure and like in the old days people did like uh zero crossing counts . PhD D : Yeah , yeah . Professor C : Right . S S PhD D : Well , I can also th use this . Professor C : Yeah . Um , PhD D : Bec - because the result are a little bit better but we have in a point that everything is more or less the similar {disfmarker} more or less similar . Professor C : Yeah . But um PhD D : It 's not quite better . Professor C : Right , but it seemed to me that what you were what you were getting at before was that there is something about the difference between the original signal or the original FFT and with the filter which is what {disfmarker} and the variance was one take uh on it . PhD D : Yeah , I used this too . Professor C : Right . But it {disfmarker} it could be something else . Suppose you didn't have anything like that . Then in that case , if you have two nets , Alright , and this one has three outputs , and this one has f PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : whatever , fifty - six , or something , PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : if you were to sum up the probabilities for the voiced and for the unvoiced and for the silence here , we 've found in the past you 'll do better at voiced - unvoiced - silence than you do with this one . So just having the three output thing doesn't {disfmarker} doesn't really buy you anything . The issue is what you feed it . PhD D : Yeah . Yeah , I have {disfmarker} yeah . Professor C : So uh PhD D : No {disfmarker} PhD E : So you 're saying take the features that go into the voiced - unvoiced - silence net and feed those into the other one , as additional inputs , rather than having a separate {disfmarker} Professor C : w W well that 's another way . PhD D : Yeah . Professor C : That wasn't what I was saying but yeah that 's certainly another thing to do . No I was just trying to say if you b if you bring this into the picture over this , what more does it buy you ? PhD E : Mmm . Professor C : And what I was saying is that the only thing I think that it buys you is um based on whether you feed it something different . And something different in some fundamental way . And so the kind of thing that {disfmarker} that she was talking about before , was looking at something uh ab um {disfmarker} something uh about the difference between the {disfmarker} the uh um log FFT uh log power uh and the log magnitude uh F F - spectrum uh and the um uh filter bank . PhD D : Yeah . Professor C : And so the filter bank is chosen in fact to sort of integrate out the effects of pitch and she 's saying you know trying {disfmarker} So the particular measure that she chose was the variance of this m of this difference , but that might not be the right number . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Maybe . Professor C : Right ? I mean maybe there 's something about the variance that 's {disfmarker} that 's not enough or maybe there 's something else that {disfmarker} that one could use , but I think that , for me , the thing that {disfmarker} that struck me was that uh you wanna get something back here , so here 's {disfmarker} here 's an idea . uh What about it you skip all the {disfmarker} all the really clever things , and just fed the log magnitude spectrum into this ? PhD D : Ah {disfmarker} I 'm sorry . Professor C : This is f You have the log magnitude spectrum , and you were looking at that and the difference between the filter bank and {disfmarker} and c c computing the variance . PhD D : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Professor C : That 's a clever thing to do . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : What if you stopped being clever ? And you just took this thing in here because it 's a neural net and neural nets are wonderful PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : and figure out what they can {disfmarker} what they most need from things , and I mean that 's what they 're good at . PhD D : Yeah . Professor C : So I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're trying to be clever and say what 's the statistic that should {disfmarker} we should get about this difference but uh in fact , you know maybe just feeding this in or {disfmarker} or feeding both of them in PhD E : Hmm . Professor C : you know , another way , saying let it figure out what 's the {disfmarker} what is the interaction , especially if you do this over multiple frames ? PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Then you have this over time , and {disfmarker} and both kinds of measures and uh you might get uh something better . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Um . PhD E : So {disfmarker} so don't uh {disfmarker} don't do the division , but let the net have everything . Professor C : That 's another thing you could do yeah . Yeah . PhD D : Yeah . Professor C : Um . I mean , it seems to me , if you have exactly the right thing then it 's better to do it without the net because otherwise you 're asking the net to learn this {disfmarker} you know , say if you wanted to learn how to do multiplication . PhD E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : I mean you could feed it a bunch of s you could feed two numbers that you wanted to multiply into a net and have a bunch of nonlinearities in the middle and train it to get the product of the output and it would work . But , it 's kind of crazy , cuz we know how to multiply and you {disfmarker} you 'd be you know much lower error usually {vocalsound} if you just multiplied it out . But suppose you don't really know what the right thing is . And that 's what these sort of dumb machine learning methods are good at . So . Um . Anyway . It 's just a thought . PhD E : How long does it take , Carmen , to train up one of these nets ? PhD D : Oh , not too much . PhD E : Yeah . PhD D : Mmm , one day or less . PhD E : Hmm . Professor C : Yeah , it 's probably worth it . Grad A : What are {disfmarker} what are your f uh frame error rates for {disfmarker} for this ? PhD D : Eh fifty - f six uh no , the frame error rate ? Grad A : O PhD D : Fifty - six I think . Professor C : Is that {disfmarker} maybe that 's accuracy ? PhD D : Percent . Grad A : Fif - fifty - six percent accurate for v voice - unvoice PhD D : The accuracy . Mm - hmm . No for , yes f I don't remember for voice - unvoice , Grad A : Oh , OK . PhD D : maybe for the other one . Grad A : OK . Professor C : Yeah , voiced - unvoiced hopefully would be a lot better . PhD D : for voiced . I don't reme Grad A : Should be in nineties somewhere . PhD D : Better . Maybe for voice - unvoice . Grad A : Right . PhD D : This is for the other one . I should {disfmarker} I can't show that . Grad A : OK . PhD D : But I think that fifty - five was for the {disfmarker} when the output are the fifty - six phone . Grad A : Mm - hmm . PhD D : That I look in the {disfmarker} with the other {disfmarker} nnn the other MLP that we have are more or less the same number . Silence will be better but more or less the same . Professor C : I think at the frame level for fifty - six that was the kind of number we were getting for {disfmarker} for uh um reduced band width uh stuff . PhD D : I think that {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that for the other one , for the three output , is sixty sixty - two , sixty three more or less . Grad A : Mm - hmm . Professor C : That 's all ? PhD D : It 's {disfmarker} Yeah . Professor C : That 's pretty bad . PhD D : Yeah , because it 's noise also . Grad A : Oh yeah . Professor C : Aha ! PhD D : And we have Professor C : Aha ! Yeah . Yeah . OK . PhD D : I know . Professor C : But even i in {disfmarker} Oh yeah , in training . Still , Uh . Well actually , so this is a test that you should do then . Um , if you 're getting fifty - six percent over here , uh that 's in noise also , right ? PhD D : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Professor C : Oh OK . If you 're getting fifty - six here , try adding together the probabilities of all of the voiced phones here and all of the unvoiced phones PhD D : will be {disfmarker} Professor C : and see what you get then . PhD D : Yeah . Professor C : I bet you get better than sixty - three . PhD D : Well I don't know , but {disfmarker} I th I {disfmarker} I think that we {disfmarker} I have the result more or less . Maybe . I don't know . I don't {disfmarker} I 'm not sure but I remember @ @ that I can't show that . Professor C : OK , but that 's a {disfmarker} That is a {disfmarker} a good check point , you should do that anyway , PhD D : Yeah . Professor C : OK ? Given this {disfmarker} this uh regular old net that 's just for choosing for other purposes , uh add up the probabilities of the different subclasses and see {disfmarker} see how well you do . Uh and that {disfmarker} you know anything that you do over here should be at least as good as that . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : OK . PhD D : I will do that . But {disfmarker} PhD E : The targets for the neural net , uh , they come from forced alignments ? PhD D : Uh , {comment} no . Grad A : TIMIT canonical ma mappings . PhD D : TIMIT . Professor C : Oh . So , this is trained on TIMIT . PhD E : Ah ! OK . Grad A : Yeah , noisy TIMIT . PhD D : Yeah . Professor C : OK . PhD D : Yeah this for TIMIT . Professor C : But noisy TIMIT ? Grad A : Right . PhD D : Noisy TIMIT . We have noisy TIMIT with the noise of the {disfmarker} the TI - digits . And now we have another noisy TIMIT also with the noise of uh Italian database . Professor C : I see . Yeah . Well there 's gonna be {disfmarker} it looks like there 's gonna be a noisy uh {disfmarker} some large vocabulary noisy stuff too . Somebody 's preparing . PhD E : Really ? Professor C : Yeah . I forget what it 'll be , resource management , Wall Street Journal , something . Some {disfmarker} some read task actually , that they 're {disfmarker} preparing . Grad A : Hmm ! PhD E : For what {disfmarker} For Aurora ? Professor C : Yeah . PhD E : Oh ! Professor C : Yeah , so the uh {disfmarker} Uh , the issue is whether people make a decision now based on what they 've already seen , or they make it later . And one of the arguments for making it later is let 's make sure that whatever techniques that we 're using work for something more than {disfmarker} than connected digits . PhD E : Hmm . Professor C : So . PhD E : When are they planning {disfmarker} When would they do that ? Professor C : Mmm , I think late {disfmarker} uh I think in the summer sometime . PhD E : Hmm . Professor C : So . OK , thanks .","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

PhD D : Well eh you know that I work {disfmarker} I begin to work with a new feature to detect voice - unvoice. PhD E : Mm - hmm. PhD D : What I trying two MLP to {disfmarker} to the {disfmarker} with this new feature and the fifteen feature uh from the eh bus base system PhD E : The {disfmarker} the mel cepstrum? PhD D : No, satly the mes the Mel Cepstrum, the new base system {disfmarker} the new base system. PhD E : Oh the {disfmarker} PhD D : Yeah, we {disfmarker} PhD E : OK, the Aurora system. PhD D : yeah the Aurora system with the new filter, VAD or something like that. PhD E : OK. PhD D : And I'm trying two MLP, one one that only have t three output, voice, unvoice, and silence, Professor C : Mm - hmm. PhD D : and other one that have fifty - six output. The probabilities of the allophone. And I tried to do some experiment of recognition with that and only have result with {disfmarker} with the MLP with the three output. And I put together the fifteen features and the three MLP output. And, well, the result are li a little bit better, but more or less similar. Professor C : Uh, I {disfmarker} I'm {disfmarker} I'm slightly confused. PhD E : Hmm. Professor C : What {disfmarker} what feeds the uh {disfmarker} the three - output net? PhD D : Voice, unvoice, and si Professor C : No no, what feeds it? What features does it see? PhD D : The feature {disfmarker} the input? The inputs are the fifteen {disfmarker} the fifteen uh bases feature. Professor C : Uh - huh. PhD D : the {disfmarker} with the new code. And the other three features are R, the variance of the difference between the two spectrum, Professor C : Uh - huh. PhD D : the variance of the auto - correlation function, except the {disfmarker} the first point, because half the height value is R - zero Professor C : Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.

Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Drop everything . Yeah . Marketing : Drop , yeah . Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : We went straight into finance ? {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah it was more important , so I just Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : For {disfmarker} Yeah . Project Manager : pushed up the agenda . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Uh , evaluation criteria . You have t produced something about that ? Marketing : Yeah that that's {disfmarker} Yeah . I uh I sure did . And it combines with product evaluation . Uh so {disfmarker} Project Manager : Uh you put it in the {gap} . Marketing : We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . So what we have left on the {disfmarker} Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : F_ five . Marketing : {vocalsound} Let's make it big . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following .

Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Um {disfmarker} Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself .

Marketing : it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So do you think {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Well , we have extended menus , on the on the L_C_D_ screen . So {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . You can you can ma User Interface : Yep . Marketing : Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I {gap} No . Marketing : So on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ? User Interface : Two or three . Two or three . Marketing : Huh ? Two or three ? Something like that ? Project Manager : Two . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Well we have to choose one . So uh what do you say ? Project Manager : Uh y we should fill this in now . Marketing : I agree on two . Project Manager : Yeah okay . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} Marketing : I uh I say two , personally . But {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah alright . Marketing : Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now . Project Manager : Okay then I say three . Marketing : Yeah ? You say three , Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah . Marketing : and you you said al also three ? User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Three ? Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Hey , you're marketing , eh . {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah I know . So it's made bold . But it's {disfmarker} nah , it's not very clear on the sc Project Manager : Hmm . M maybe underline . User Interface : Or give it a colour . Marketing : Maybe other colour , yeah . That's better . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Red . {vocalsound} Marketing : Uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Alright . Oh , it doesn't have to be bold anymore . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Oh yeah very true . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Alright . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah true one . {vocalsound} Marketing : Um well the remote control has {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Wha {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} He types everything . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Definitely one . It has to be . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : {vocalsound} The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . For example audio settings and screen settings . User Interface : It hides uh basic functions . {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Everything . {vocalsound} You don't use anything else . {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} You're not gonna find them . Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah okay . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah true . Marketing : But , I mean uh they're hidden in the screen . If you don't want to use them , you don't s you s just scroll over them . And you place them {disfmarker} Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : {vocalsound} F I don't know where . So that's very true , I guess , for our case . Industrial Designer : Yeah the next {disfmarker} Not so much so . Marketing : Uh the second point . It shows the relevant and most used functions . Project Manager : Nope . Marketing : Power button . Do we ha still have a power button ? Project Manager : Uh check with the Excel sheet . Marketing : Well yeah the button's integrated , huh ? User Interface : {vocalsound} I think we are {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah it's uh it's integrated . Marketing : Yeah we dropped it . You j you just push it in for {disfmarker} User Interface : It's in {disfmarker} Oh yeah it was integrateds . Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah integrate it . Marketing : Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : E exactly just like a m mobile . Marketing : Yeah . I don't know . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Just go scrolling and it will activate . {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah . Um it shows the relevant and most used functions . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {gap} . Marketing : Yeah uh on the other {disfmarker} uh on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no . So it's {disfmarker} I don't know . Project Manager : It shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but {disfmarker} User Interface : Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : No , you have to scroll through the menu , before Marketing : With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel . And then {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah . So it's it's not {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if {disfmarker} When it's on , yeah , it's turned on , Project Manager : You say you double click on the {disfmarker} Marketing : Hmm ? Industrial Designer : It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some {gap} {disfmarker} Of you {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Or you double click it . Marketing : But but how do you change from volume to channel ? Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : No because it has four arrows , right ? Project Manager : No , not anymore . User Interface : No . {vocalsound} Marketing : No . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Because he's {gap} now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in . Industrial Designer : Oh yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Like on the the mouse . Industrial Designer : Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick . Marketing : No we have n we have no buttons left . So {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Say . Marketing : the joystick was not an option . Industrial Designer : Yeah that is a bummer . Marketing : So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so you hav {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} Marketing : So you you have to double-click , I mean , for , I mean , uh volume , Project Manager : To get into menu . Yeah . Marketing : and three double click for the menu , or something . User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh no . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Or hold it ten seconds . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} We'll make it a Morse code . Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Alright . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : But but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you . Project Manager : No no no . Uh it should be trendy . {vocalsound} Marketing : So that's {disfmarker} User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah but that that's not a question . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Well I think it's pretty much in the middle . Project Manager : Yeah . Four . Marketing : You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . So {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah , im {disfmarker} in the menu . User Interface : Seven . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : So maybe it's more like a f a five . Or {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah . Five . Industrial Designer : Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Five or six ? Project Manager : Five . User Interface : Five . Yep . Industrial Designer : Okay five . Marketing : Five ? Alright . Industrial Designer : Let's not diss our remote . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : Oh . {vocalsound} Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yep . Just one button . {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Well it's different . {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah . Alright . Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . Industrial Designer : But {disfmarker} Uh yep . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation . Project Manager : Yeah , it's still {disfmarker} Yeah , I say two . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} We still have the fruit and vegetable print . Marketing : I say two then . Project Manager : Oh , that's the next . {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that that's not that's not this question . Uh thi uh that's the other question . Industrial Designer : Fr Oh I mean the {disfmarker} Oh never mind . I'm a bit lost . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : This one . User Interface : I think a two . No . Project Manager : Two . Marketing : Two yeah . Industrial Designer : {gap} . User Interface : Yep . Marketing : I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah definitely . Marketing : What ? Oh not the bold one . Industrial Designer : It's way more practical , yeah . Marketing : Right . Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : {vocalsound} It should have been two questions . {vocalsound} I realise now , because {vocalsound} sponge-like material is dropped . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : But the look and feel {disfmarker} Project Manager : You still have rubber d Or no . Industrial Designer : Yeah . So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button . User Interface : No you got a plastic . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : The button has also colour . Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Project Manager : {vocalsound} The one button we have . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah . The one . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve . Project Manager : Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet . Marketing : Mm mm . User Interface : Yeah . You only have one {disfmarker} Yeah . Marketing : Yeah we have single curve now , Industrial Designer : And and colour . Marketing : and no and no material Industrial Designer : Yeah . S Marketing : . So maybe in the middle or something . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Four . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , I mean it's Project Manager : Yeah or three . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} Marketing : worth the {disfmarker} Yeah . Project Manager : We have something . Industrial Designer : Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . Because it's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . Still , it's still hard . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . Project Manager : New . Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . But then we would have to drop the screen . User Interface : Red . {vocalsound} Marketing : Oh red . Yeah . Project Manager : You like both . {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} I like bold . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Um oh yeah . User Interface : {vocalsound} Mm yeah yeah . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Of course . Project Manager : {vocalsound} I just couldn't {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} You just have to draw it . {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Um , just one minute . User Interface : It's the white part uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah but it {disfmarker} be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the {disfmarker} Project Manager : {gap} . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : So {disfmarker} User Interface : We have a we have a {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . But {disfmarker} Marketing : But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , {vocalsound} if there's only one thing . Industrial Designer : Hell yeah . If we have only one button . Marketing : Yeah . So I will say that is very true . Project Manager : {gap} . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : doesn't it ? Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} Marketing : {vocalsound} The remote control is easy to use . Well I would say {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : No . Marketing : Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button . User Interface : Ah i Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : And that you only have to control one button . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah exactly . Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah . It it it has a nice screen . But {disfmarker} Yeah . User Interface : It gives visual feedback . So {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six . User Interface : I think a five . Five . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I would say six . Marketing : What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ? Industrial Designer : It's really not easy to use . User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : No not anymore . User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : 'Cause you're putting everything {disfmarker} Marketing : So a six , more . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , uh I would go for the six too . So {disfmarker} User Interface : Okay . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Most votes count . Um {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Um well , another question , User Interface : Yeah that looks uh great . Marketing : uh the remote control is durable . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : I don't know if that's the correct word . User Interface : Yeah . Nah {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic Marketing : But uh {disfmarker} In use , both battery as casing ? Industrial Designer : {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever . Marketing : Yeah ? True , true . Industrial Designer : And the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever . Marketing : And the casing is plastic , {gap} ? User Interface : Yep . Marketing : Yeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So I would go for one . Marketing : Yeah ? But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate User Interface : Yeah . S Project Manager : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} User Interface : Yep . Industrial Designer : Okay yeah . Marketing : than {disfmarker} User Interface : Wow . {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah . Logo . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Okay I will go {disfmarker} go for two . {vocalsound} Uh the last one ? The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Oh . No m User Interface : No we put the electronics into the fashion . {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah well {disfmarker} yeah . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I would g Marketing : {vocalsound} {gap} uh {disfmarker} {gap} turn around . Yeah . But um {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : I would go for four . Project Manager : No {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah ? Industrial Designer : Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . Marketing : It's not {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , true . Project Manager : Yeah okay . Marketing : So a four . It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it g it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah yeah . User Interface : Yeah , four is okay . Marketing : Alright , yeah . Right . Project Manager : So {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : That's it . Marketing : So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers . Project Manager : Ooh . And {disfmarker} Yeah ? What ? Marketing : Uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Oh {disfmarker} Alright . Word document , the {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah . That {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah we have to count them . Project Manager : Count them . Add them ? Or {disfmarker} Marketing : Uh {disfmarker} Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . Project Manager : Could somebody start calculator ? {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah . Mm . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Ah we can do the math . Uh {disfmarker} Marketing : I all made it po I I all made it User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : I mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , Project Manager : Yeah , yeah . You have to {disfmarker} Marketing : uh {disfmarker} Yes . Project Manager : 'Kay . So four and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah . Did you make this questionnaire or what ? Marketing : Yeah . {vocalsound} Thanks . {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Nice work . User Interface : Okay . Industrial Designer : Oh . User Interface : Three plus ? Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I wouldn't be able to do it that fast . Project Manager : O one . User Interface : Plus one . Project Manager : Plus five . User Interface : Plus five ? Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh {disfmarker} Easy . Project Manager : Bo {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Question number four , yeah ? Project Manager : Uh two . Marketing : Yeah . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Four . User Interface : Oh . Wait a second . Oh . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : F Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : It's it's gone wrong . Marketing : {vocalsound} How hard is it ? User Interface : Okay . It's your turn . Industrial Designer : Pretty difficult . Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah just use {disfmarker} Project Manager : Start over ? User Interface : No it's if you press twice on the plus button , then you get s s Marketing : Oh there tho uh there's no n There's no num pads . Project Manager : You can {disfmarker} Oh yeah . {vocalsound} User Interface : No . That's why it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} It's a it's a bit uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Just type in the digits . They're all one digit numbers right ? And then you can count them together . Marketing : Yeah . I think you can just count them by a {disfmarker} User Interface : Just count it to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah . Marketing : Um let's move over . Project Manager : Okay . Three , four , nine . Marketing : Three , plus one , four . Nine . Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} Marketing : Uh , yeah . Are you here ? Industrial Designer : Eleven . Marketing : Eleven . Project Manager : Eleven , Industrial Designer : Fifteen . Marketing : Fifteen . Project Manager : fifteen . User Interface : Sixteen . Industrial Designer : Sixteen . Marketing : Sixteen , yeah . Industrial Designer : Seventeen . Project Manager : Seventeen . Marketing : No sixteen . Uh sixteen plus six . Industrial Designer : Oh what ? User Interface : Twenty two . {vocalsound} Project Manager : S Uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} How hard is this ? {vocalsound} Marketing : Twenty two . Twenty two , yeah ? User Interface : Twenty four . Twenty six . Industrial Designer : Never mind . Twenty four . Twenty eight . Marketing : Tw User Interface : Oh , sorry . {gap} . Marketing : Twenty {disfmarker} Twenty eight . Project Manager : That was the last one . That was that . User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh my . Industrial Designer : Twenty eight . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Okay . Twenty eight . Project Manager : So divided by nine . Marketing : Twen Uh okay . By nine . User Interface : Hmm . Marketing : That's uh three uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Or le less than a three . Project Manager : So {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah the lower the {disfmarker} The lower the score the better , right ? Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Twenty eight Industrial Designer : Yeah but {disfmarker} Project Manager : Divided by nine . Marketing : di divided by nine Project Manager : So thr t two . Marketing : makes three point one one one one one one one . Project Manager : So we're better than average .","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

Project Manager : Yeah, this the last phase of course, so {disfmarker} Marketing : Uh the agenda. By your humble P_M_. Project Manager : Hmm. {vocalsound} Oh. Marketing : {vocalsound} Oh f {vocalsound} Frustrated. {vocalsound} Alright. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Okay. Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation. But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense, because we had to drop it. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Drop everything. Yeah. Marketing : Drop, yeah. Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : We went straight into finance? {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah. User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah it was more important, so I just Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah. Yeah. Industrial Designer : For {disfmarker} Yeah. Project Manager : pushed up the agenda. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Project Manager : Uh, evaluation criteria. You have t produced something about that? Marketing : Yeah that that's {disfmarker} Yeah. I uh I sure did. And it combines with product evaluation. Uh so {disfmarker} Project Manager : Uh you put it in the {gap}. Marketing : We all have to keep in mind what has changed now. So what we have left on the {disfmarker} Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements. Project Manager : Yeah. Marketing : Alright. Project Manager : F_ five. Marketing : {vocalsound} Let's make it big. {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale, as following. Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah. True or false, and then on a scale of seven points, a {gap} scale, as we all know it. Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Um {disfmarker} Well the criteria are based on the user requirements, uh the trends from the marketing research, and the marketing strategy of the company itself. Um well they are in a Word document, which I will open now. Project Manager : Alt up Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah. I don't know it's open yet. No. And we all have to uh agree on a certain level. What's this? Project Manager : {vocalsound} Freaky. {vocalsound} Marketing : Oh. I don't know. Um {disfmarker} Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user. So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions. How do you think about that? Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I think it does. Because the operating {gap} behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_, Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : right? Project Manager : Uh, of course we dropped a little bit of those uh {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah the us u It it {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions, in this question. Project Manager : Mm-hmm. Marketing : So do you think {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Well, we have extended menus, on the on the L_C_D_ screen. So {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah. You can you can ma User Interface : Yep. Marketing : Yeah, you can make a lot of extended menus. That's true. I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited, to to build in menus in the screen. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} I {gap} No. Marketing : So on a scale from one to seven, what do you think? User Interface : Two or three. Two or three. Marketing : Huh? Two or three? Something like that? Project Manager : Two. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : Well we have to choose one. So uh what do you say? Project Manager : Uh y we should fill this in now. Marketing : I agree on two. Project Manager : Yeah okay. Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : Uh {disfmarker} Marketing : I uh I say two, personally. But {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three. But now, in original design I say two. User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Yeah alright. Marketing : Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now. Project Manager : Okay then I say three. Marketing : Yeah? You say three, Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah. Marketing : and you you said al also three? User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : Three? Okay well I say still two, but it has to be three then. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Hey, you're marketing, eh. {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah I know. So it's made bold. But it's {disfmarker} nah, it's not very clear on the sc Project Manager : Hmm. M maybe underline. User Interface : Or give it a colour. Marketing : Maybe other colour, yeah. That's better. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Red. {vocalsound} Marketing : Uh {disfmarker} Yeah. Alright. Oh, it doesn't have to be bold anymore. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Oh yeah very true. User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Alright. Yeah. User Interface : Yeah true one. {vocalsound} Marketing : Um well the remote control has {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Wha {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} He types everything. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Definitely one. It has to be. User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions. For example audio settings and screen settings. User Interface : It hides uh basic functions. {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Everything. {vocalsound} You don't use anything else. {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah. Well, yeah. So it it's a very true point. I mean it hides all those function. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} You're not gonna find them. Project Manager : Yeah. Yeah okay. Yeah. User Interface : Yeah true. Marketing : But, I mean uh they're hidden in the screen. If you don't want to use them, you don't s you s just scroll over them. And you place them {disfmarker} Project Manager : Mm-hmm. Marketing : {vocalsound} F I don't know where. So that's very true, I guess, for our case. Industrial Designer : Yeah the next {disfmarker} Not so much so. Marketing : Uh the second point. It shows the relevant and most used functions. Project Manager : Nope. Marketing : Power button. Do we ha still have a power button? Project Manager : Uh check with the Excel sheet. Marketing : Well yeah the button's integrated, huh? User Interface : {vocalsound} I think we are {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah. Yeah it's uh it's integrated. Marketing : Yeah we dropped it. You j you just push it in for {disfmarker} User Interface : It's in {disfmarker} Oh yeah it was integrateds. Yeah. Project Manager : Yeah integrate it. Marketing : Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something, and then {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : E exactly just like a m mobile. Marketing : Yeah. I don't know. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Just go scrolling and it will activate. {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah. Um it shows the relevant and most used functions. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {gap}. Marketing : Yeah uh on the other {disfmarker} uh on one side I would say yes, and the other side I would say no. So it's {disfmarker} I don't know. Project Manager : It shows the most used functions and they are relevant, but {disfmarker} User Interface : Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button? Marketing : Yeah. User Interface : No, you have to scroll through the menu, before Marketing : With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel. And then {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah. So it's it's not {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something, if {disfmarker} When it's on, yeah, it's turned on, Project Manager : You say you double click on the {disfmarker} Marketing : Hmm? Industrial Designer : It automatically has the the programme and the volume function, Marketing : Yeah. Industrial Designer : but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some {gap} {disfmarker} Of you {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Or you double click it. Marketing : But but how do you change from volume to channel? Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : No because it has four arrows, right? Project Manager : No, not anymore. User Interface : No. {vocalsound} Marketing : No. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Because he's {gap} now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in. Industrial Designer : Oh yeah. User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : Like on the the mouse. Industrial Designer : Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick. Marketing : No we have n we have no buttons left. So {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Say. Marketing : the joystick was not an option. Industrial Designer : Yeah that is a bummer. Marketing : So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so you hav {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah. {vocalsound} Marketing : So you you have to double-click, I mean, for, I mean, uh volume, Project Manager : To get into menu. Yeah. Marketing : and three double click for the menu, or something. User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh no.

Oh not the bold one. Industrial Designer : It's way more practical, yeah. Marketing : Right. Okay, it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints, primary colours and sponge-like material. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} It should have been two questions. {vocalsound} I realise now, because {vocalsound} sponge-like material is dropped. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : But the look and feel {disfmarker} Project Manager : You still have rubber d Or no. Industrial Designer : Yeah.

Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} Marketing : worth the {disfmarker} Yeah. Project Manager : We have something. Industrial Designer : Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one. Because it's basically an old one, uh with little curve on the side, and in a different colour. Still, it's still hard. Marketing : Yeah. Industrial Designer : I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape, that would give it something young and fresh. Project Manager : New. Yeah. Marketing : Yeah. But then we would have to drop the screen. User Interface : Red. {vocalsound} Marketing : Oh red. Yeah. Project Manager : You like both. {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah. {vocalsound} I like bold. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Um oh yeah.

941,"Nick Brazil : Could I jump in there? I've got to jump in there as, from the institution I'm in, we've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities. About 20 per cent of our learners go to Russell Group universities, and there is no doubt—in certainly 50 per cent of those, they do not value the Welsh bac. But if they do offer an option with the Welsh bac, they say it is on top of three A2-level grades. So, obviously, we've had that track record. I think the Seren programme that's been put in by the Welsh Government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses, but you look through the range, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects as well, across a number and range of universities, the Welsh bac is always added as the additional one. So, bear in mind, then, that Welsh students are fighting for places against Scottish, Northern Irish and, potentially, English students who are studying three subjects, whereas our Welsh students potentially could be doing three A2s, three A-level subjects plus the Welsh bac. And, as we talked about earlier on, the Welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous, you could say complicated, qualification, which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they're trying to get possibly three A* grades. So, I think we need to consider that. In relation to the first answer, it is variable, and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions, and also make the decision dependent on whether it's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject, which the Russell Group report indicates about facilitating subjects, and Welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

956,"The Chair : The next question goes to Mrs. Kusie. Mrs. Stephanie Kusie (Calgary Midnapore, CPC) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. It has been three months since this pandemic started and the Liberals just got around to announcing help for seniors. Seniors are a priority and should be treated as such. Why do the Liberals treat seniors as an afterthought? The Chair : The honourable minister. Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors) : Thank you very much. There is definitely an interest in and support for our seniors. We've been working to support seniors since the very beginning of this pandemic. I've just had the opportunity to introduce additional measures today wherein we are introducing a one-time special payment for those who receive OAS. Mrs. Stephanie Kusie : Nearly two months into living in some form of isolation, watching their retirement savings take a hit and having to take additional health precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, eligible seniors are set to receive a one-time payment of up to $500. Why does this government consistently undervalue seniors compared with everyone else? Hon. Deb Schulte : I just want to make sure that my honourable colleague remembers that we have already given a GST top-up of almost $375 for single seniors and over $500 for couples. This is in addition to what we've just done today where, as you said, it's $500. Mrs. Stephanie Kusie : According to Abacus Data, 69% of Canadians feel that there will be a second wave in the pandemic, and 52% of Canadians believe that there is a shortage of medical equipment, including personal protective equipment. Given these surprising figures, what is the government's plan to bring in enough personal protective equipment, should there be a second wave of the pandemic? Hon. Anita Anand (Minister of Public Services and Procurement) : Our government is aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies that Canada needs, from a diverse range of suppliers around the world and here at home. We're working directly with businesses across the country to rapidly scale up domestic production capacity to meet current and future needs. At this point, our primary focus is on front-line health care professionals, but we are also exploring federal government assistance in areas of essential services so that PPE exists where workers need it. We are following public health guidance on this issue in looking to see where we can best assist. Mrs. Stephanie Kusie : According to Public Services and Procurement Canada, despite 1.8 billion units of PPE being procured, less than 6% of N95 respirator orders have been filled, less than 8% of surgical mask orders have been filled, and just 1.4% of face shield orders have been filled. We know that orders are not deliveries, so what's the delay? Hon. Anita Anand : Let me start by saying that we are working in an incredibly difficult and competitive global environment and are procuring millions of items: face shields, gowns, hand sanitizer, and N95 surgical masks, and ventilators every single day. There is a delay in the production of these goods, but we have had many deliveries coming into Canada, including over two million face shields The Chair : We'll have to go back to Mrs. Kusie. Mrs. Stephanie Kusie : A national security expert from the University of Ottawa has said that the national emergency strategic stockpile has failed in the current crisis, resulting in some provinces such as Saskatchewan using expired PPE, and provinces such as Alberta using faulty PPE that cause rashes and headaches. What is the government doing to expedite procurement and to counter the risk of faulty PPE, given that 34 of the suppliers are from China, which has already supplied significant faulty PPE? Hon. Anita Anand : I will start by saying that we have multiple supply chains operating at the same time, from China, and domestically, and from the United States and other countries around the world. Our first priority is to make sure that we get safe, effective equipment and supplies into the hands of our front-line health care workers. Given the global supply chains and their competitive nature, this is an ongoing project and we are having success for our front-line health care workers. The Chair : We'll now go on to the next question from Mr. d'Entremont. Mr. Chris d'Entremont (West Nova, CPC) : Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Ten weeks ago the Minister of Fisheries, in responding to my question in question period, acknowledged that the lobster fishery was being negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and was facing losses of up to 95% of its Asian markets. Mr. Chair, on April 28 I asked the minister what she was doing to support harvesters who were left out of the $62.5 million aid package. She mentioned that she was looking at sector-specific areas to make sure that the issues were addressed. Can the minister tell us what the government's plan is to directly support seafood harvesters? The Chair : The honourable minister. Hon. Bernadette Jordan (Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard) : Thank you, Mr. Chair. I thank my colleague for that very good question. We know that the fish and seafood sector has been extremely adversely affected because of COVID-19. We've started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $62.5 million for processors, as well as to make sure that the CERB is available for seasonal workers as well as people who have run out of their fishery EI, but we know that more needs to be done. The fishery enterprises are uniquely structured, which is why we're looking at measures to address the concerns they have. I'm working with my provincial colleagues, as well as my caucus colleagues. Mr. Chris d'Entremont : Mr. Chair, most fishermen are not eligible for the wage subsidy program due to the stipulation that it cannot be used for employees who are related to their employer. Most fishing enterprises, like farm enterprises, are family oriented. Many fishermen have their wives, their sons, their uncles or their fathers working for them, and sometimes it's the whole family on the boat. Can the minister explain what the government's plan is to support fishermen who do not fit into any actual program and who desperately need direct financial help from the federal government to survive? Hon. Bernadette Jordan : Mr. Chair, we know that, because of the unique structure of fishing enterprises, they are not eligible for many of the supports we have put in place. We have made changes to the CERB to make sure that people who run out of the fishers EI are eligible as well as seasonable workers. We know that more needs to be done for the harvesters directly. We are working on direct supports. We have put in place measures to address processors' concerns so that harvesters continue to have a place to sell their product. We know that more has to be done. I am working with my cabinet colleagues to find solutions, and I hope I will have more to say about that very soon. Mr. Chris d'Entremont : In recent weeks, lobster fishermen in the gulf region of the Maritimes were shocked to read an additional subsection of regulations that was added to their fishing conditions for the 2021 fishing season. This addition was for a catch limitation or quota to which none of the harvesters or advisory members were privy. This created quite a chill within the lobster fishery, for sure. Can the minister tell us how these detailed regulations managed to get added without her authorization, and can licence-holders expect to see these same regulations in their conditions when their season gets going in the future? Hon. Bernadette Jordan : Mr. Chair, I want to thank the people who brought to my attention the conditions that were put on licences in the gulf. Those were not done under my authorization. They were removed right away from the condition of licence, and they will not happen. Mr. Chris d'Entremont : My next question is for the Minister of Health. Mr. Chair, on Wednesday, February 26, after the death of 23-year-old Chantelle Lindsay from Nova Scotia due to complications from cystic fibrosis, I asked the Prime Minister whether the government was going to make Trikafta, which might have saved Chantelle's life, available to Canadians. Now that almost 12 weeks have passed, we understand that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has not yet applied to Health Canada for study. Many of my Conservative colleagues and I have recently sent a letter to the minister asking for an update on how we support those negotiations with Vertex. Can the Minister of Health tell us when this drug will be available to CF patients in Canada? The Chair : Honourable minister, the floor is yours. Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health) : Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. My heart goes out to the family of Chantelle, who are obviously suffering an unbearable loss. I agree with the member that we want to make sure that effective drugs are available in Canada. As the member has pointed out, Vertex has not applied to sell Trikafta in Canada. However, there is the special access program that makes drugs like Trikafta available. In fact, the majority of people who have applied through the special access program to get access to the drug have received access. I would encourage the member to continue his correspondence with the manufacturer, as will we. The Chair : Mr. d'Entremont, you have 36 seconds. Mr. Chris d'Entremont : Mr.Chair, the tourism season is already deeply affected by COVID-19. A number of industries, businesses and festivals are having to deal with considerable losses of income. In my constituency, tens of thousands of tourists use the ferry between Bar Harbor, Maine, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. What is the government planning to do to help the ferry to survive and to resume service next season, if the borders remain closed this summer? Hon. Mlanie Joly (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages) : I have had the opportunity to speak to my colleague Mr.d'Entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country, and particularly in the Atlantic region. In light of the new funding for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, I will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector.","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

Or {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : I suppose I've got quite big hands . Project Manager : I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . Marketing : Well {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : But you know what I've just thought of there now . What {disfmarker} where's it gonna sit in your living room ? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? Project Manager : Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like Marketing : Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : round . User Interface : But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand {vocalsound} . Marketing : Oh . That's true . Project Manager : It would still be comfortable I think . We c we could handle it I think . Industrial Designer : Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly . User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . Marketing : Maybe , it could {disfmarker} it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Like that . User Interface : Oh that would be nice . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Ah it'd fall over all the time though . It'd be annoying . Industrial Designer : Uh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : I g If it's weighted maybe . Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} 'Kay we're done designing . Industrial Designer : H it's got higher centre of gravity like that . Marketing : {vocalsound} Details , details . {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Come on . Marketing : Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? {vocalsound} Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? {vocalsound} User Interface : Three . You would though , 'cause it's bit {disfmarker} it's more interesting than other remotes . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : I think , it was another colour and it was like {disfmarker} I think it'd look okay . I think maybe a two . Marketing : Yeah ? Industrial Designer : I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , Marketing : I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , but {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours . Marketing : Okay , so should we say two for that ? Project Manager : Sure . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah ? User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Okay . Uh , question number five . What's um {disfmarker} will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . User Interface : I think we have to market it in the right way , that um {disfmarker} to say that it is simplistic . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : We have to market it . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah it {disfmarker} the marketing will have a lot to do with it . Industrial Designer : And {vocalsound} the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , User Interface : And the kinetic energy part . Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . {vocalsound} Durable . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : ooh no . {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Shake it and the buttons fall off . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} But you know , those'll be firmly on . User Interface : {vocalsound} Don't shake {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh no the plus . {vocalsound} You're Marketing : No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , User Interface : {disfmarker} use the zero . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Make a new one . Project Manager : But you're our Marketing Expert . {vocalsound} Marketing : but {disfmarker} I know I am , aren't I ? User Interface : I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? About ten pounds . Fifteen ? Marketing : But you don't have to buy batteries . So in the long term this can actually save you money . Industrial Designer : Mm , yeah , that's true . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Oh . Exactly . Exactly . Marketing : So we'll market it that way too . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Good point . Marketing : So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll {disfmarker} User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah . I would give it a two still though . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . User Interface : Mm . Marketing : Yeah . Okay number six . Can someone read it out ? Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . Marketing : Or {disfmarker} Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Um yeah . So that was mainly that the statistics {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : I think it does very well . Project Manager : Oh yeah . Industrial Designer : Because {disfmarker} Marketing : we said {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . User Interface : The zap {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : And it's just {disfmarker} you won't have to think about it . User Interface : yeah . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : You don't have to look down to find them . Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : They're clearly there , easy to use . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Simple . User Interface : Uh {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : But they're not you and I really . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : So . Okay so one ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Okay . Number seven . C Heather could you push it down ? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . Project Manager : We have the alarm system . Marketing : Now is there the {disfmarker} is the alarm system still {disfmarker} was it implemented ? User Interface : Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the {vocalsound} lights {vocalsound} behind the {disfmarker} and it'll vibra {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : It {disfmarker} Yeah Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : l lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . User Interface : It'll be again in the marketing . Project Manager : I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . User Interface : Yeah . The light {disfmarker} it will . Project Manager : Or or was it gonna make a noise ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . But when the alarm's not {disfmarker} User Interface : But {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : yeah . If you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : But both {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : You press the button it makes a noise right ? Marketing : {vocalsound} It turns into a duck and starts quacking . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : You could s {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah . Awesome . Awesome . Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh , that would be brilliant . Marketing : Here I am . User Interface : I'd be tempted to {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Well the thing is , if it was {disfmarker} had an alarm system , Marketing : {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . User Interface : It would have to be in the market Project Manager : I though w it was gonna make a noise . Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Alarm , User Interface : Yeah but you still couldn't see it . Industrial Designer : but you can't see an alarm inside uh {disfmarker} the alarm system itself . User Interface : It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : We {disfmarker} oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah . Marketing : But yeah , it'll be there . Project Manager : Oh okay . Marketing : So we can {disfmarker} we could say that {disfmarker} Project Manager : Whoo . Okay . Industrial Designer : Sorry . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . Project Manager : Yeah , totally . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Okay . Um {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Sorry Heather . User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : No problem , mm . Industrial Designer : That wasn't very clear . Marketing : Question number eight . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . Project Manager : Totally . Marketing : So it has to be {disfmarker} yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . User Interface : So the plu the plus {disfmarker} w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , Marketing : The plus thing needs to be worked on . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah User Interface : won't it ? Industrial Designer : I think {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : just because it's {disfmarker} we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . Marketing : Well {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Do {disfmarker} Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an {disfmarker} just an enter button ? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . Project Manager : Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter . User Interface : That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press {disfmarker} Marketing : {gap} Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Yeah but you don't have to press zeros . User Interface : I don't know why . {vocalsound} Marketing : You could just press six enter , User Interface : Oh okay . Right . Project Manager : And then like twelve , enter . Industrial Designer : And {disfmarker} or sixty six enter , y Marketing : or one two enter . User Interface : Alright , aye . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . Yeah . Good {gap} {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Um , okay so we can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} User Interface : I'd say w yeah one . Marketing : we'll say yes it's uh one ? Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Ooh . Mm . Marketing : Question number nine . Industrial Designer : Oh . Marketing : Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? Industrial Designer : Injury . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Um , which affected over a quarter of users . User Interface : {vocalsound} Hmm . Marketing : S Project Manager : I think so . It's like right in the {disfmarker} User Interface : But if you're zapping {disfmarker} Project Manager : Your thumb might get a little bit uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's what I was thinking . User Interface : yeah . I don't think it will f Industrial Designer : We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . User Interface : Yeah , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : the biology . Project Manager : But it is soft . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : It's soft , Project Manager : And that's kind of what the um Marketing : and {disfmarker} User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ , Marketing : And people could {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : so {disfmarker} maybe it is but {disfmarker} Marketing : I don't know what other options there are . Industrial Designer : I think we're getting {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : that's true . Marketing : Could {disfmarker} I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : So , one or two do you think ? Industrial Designer : I think {disfmarker} User Interface : I I'd say t Industrial Designer : yeah , I think too . User Interface : two . Yeah Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Two okay . Okay number ten . Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? Project Manager : Yes we did . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah . {vocalsound} Marketing : Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? User Interface : {vocalsound} N We we can't really do that Marketing : Is the yellow {disfmarker} User Interface : because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : It won't stand out . Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : So n it's not always gonna be the same colour . Marketing : It sounds like the colour's something that we {disfmarker} Project Manager : Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Gray , yeah . Project Manager : So it could be grey on the banana one . User Interface : Yeah , could be grey . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , User Interface : Yeah that's right , Marketing : depending on the {disfmarker} User Interface : we didn't even rea Marketing : So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ . Industrial Designer : Mm . Yeah . I think this is the User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : Perhaps a metallic Project Manager : Mm , yeah . User Interface : or or {disfmarker} like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . No ? Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : That isn't rubber . Marketing : And the buttons in the middle . User Interface : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah . {vocalsound} Marketing : Okay So , do you think that's more of a three then ? Three , four ? Industrial Designer : Four I think . Well I don't {disfmarker} Marketing : Four ? Industrial Designer : what do {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} Project Manager : Hum . Marketing : Well we have good reasons for it , so we {disfmarker} but we can still put a a four ? Industrial Designer : Okay . User Interface : Okay . Marketing : Okay , and final question . {vocalsound} Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . {vocalsound}","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

Do not provide anything else other than generated questions separaterd by commas. Document: Project Manager : Ooh. Marketing : Okay so number one. Do we have a fancy look-and-feel? Industrial Designer : Feel I think. User Interface : Mm. Industrial Designer : We've been quite successful with the rubber coating Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} Project Manager : The look is a little bit more playful. User Interface : Well {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah. User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy, but it's definitely different. Project Manager : Oh definitely different yeah. Marketing : It's not your traditional {disfmarker} yeah. Industrial Designer : I think the colour has a lot to do with it. I mean {vocalsound} th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen. Marketing : Mm-hmm. User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : It's not the kind of {disfmarker} ooh uh at all sleek Project Manager : Oh you were only given red and black? Industrial Designer : {disfmarker} red, black and yellow, and orange. Project Manager : Oh okay. User Interface : Yeah {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} User Interface : {vocalsound} not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey. Marketing : Yeah. User Interface : So we want it to be stand out that way, anyway. Project Manager : Yeah. Okay. Industrial Designer : But if you can imagine that in like a s just a {disfmarker} maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah. A metallic-y finish we were thinking. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Well I know know it's for rubber. Marketing : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy. {vocalsound} User Interface : Polished. Okay {disfmarker} Yeah. Project Manager : Yeah. Marketing : Yeah. I kinda {disfmarker} I like the potato look. Project Manager : It's mango. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Oh well, potato, mango, fruit and veg. User Interface : {vocalsound} We we were {vocalsound} we were thinking about {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : It's very different. It's what? Project Manager : It's mango. {vocalsound} Marketing : Oh sorry the mango the mango look. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Potato's fine. Potato's fine. User Interface : yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah it is, fruit or vegetable depends on your mood. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah. Totally. It's really adaptable. Marketing : So I myself would say a one or a two. Project Manager : Yeah. I would say two. Personally. User Interface : I w I'd say two I think. Marketing : It's a two? Industrial Designer : For the Marketing : Okay, User Interface : Fanciness. Marketing : and p Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : fancy {disfmarker} Marketing : One being true. So {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : I {disfmarker} uh two, three. {vocalsound} Marketing : Two. User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : Okay, actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing, like that. Okay so question number two was {vocalsound} is it techn technologically innovative? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative. Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Yeah and the use of the rubber. Marketing : {vocalsound} Use of the rubber, the use of the L_E_D_. Industrial Designer : For the anti-R_S_I_. User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative Marketing : Isn't {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : and we don't have any scroll buttons, it's all pushbuttons, User Interface : Mm. Industrial Designer : there's no L_C_D_ control, so if we're thinking about the rest of the market, it's sort of probably halfway. Marketing : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : In some aspects it is, like we said. Project Manager : Yeah. I'd say maybe three. User Interface : I'll go for three as well. Marketing : Yeah. And I think {disfmarker} I mean it it's tough to say because we were {disfmarker} we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this, because then that would've defeated the purpose. Project Manager : Yeah we want it simple. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Though it was our specification. User Interface : No. Wouldn't be simple, yeah. Marketing : So I mean I {disfmarker} we'll put three, but I think we actually reached our goal. Project Manager : Yeah. User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} We didn't want it any more than that. Okay question number three. Uh, will it be easy to use? Project Manager : I think so. Yeah. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Yeah. User Interface : Yeah very. Marketing : Yeah. User Interface : I think one for that. Marketing : Yeah. S Yeah Project Manager : Yeah. One. Marketing : I think it's {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah. User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : you can't really get confused with that. User Interface : No. Project Manager : Th Marketing : I mean, there'll be s we have to work out the uh number {disfmarker} the plus system. Project Manager : The plus number thing. User Interface : Yeah that's the only thing yeah. Marketing : But once that's figured out, it should be fine. Industrial Designer : Yeah and perhaps the turning on but {disfmarker} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Number four. Is this a good-looking remote? Industrial Designer : Mm. Marketing : Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. User Interface : {vocalsound} It's definitely {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Again I think the colour comes into this. Project Manager : Yeah colour will definitely be a factor. Marketing : Mm-hmm {vocalsound}. Project Manager : I think that the logo could be smaller. Industrial Designer : Okay. Project Manager : And maybe not such a prominent way. User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : Maybe like at the bottom, kind of. User Interface : But the {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Not in {disfmarker} User Interface : Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent. Project Manager : Oh it just had to be on there I guess. Marketing : Whoops. User Interface : Yeah. {vocalsound} Marketing : Should just not touch it. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Don't worry. {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} This time it's the three I killed. {vocalsound} I was just wondering if it should be like flatter. Or {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : I suppose I've got quite big hands. Project Manager : I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand. Marketing : Well {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : But you know what I've just thought of there now. What {disfmarker} where's it gonna sit in your living room? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa? Project Manager : Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat, and then the rest is like Marketing : Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit. User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : round. User Interface : But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand {vocalsound}. Marketing : Oh. That's true. Project Manager : It would still be comfortable I think. We c we could handle it I think. Industrial Designer : Thing is like that, it's not going anywhere particularly. User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah. Marketing : Maybe, it could {disfmarker} it could be on the bottom, so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here, so it sits up. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : Like that. User Interface : Oh that would be nice. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Ah it'd fall over all the time though. It'd be annoying. Industrial Designer : Uh yeah, it's less um, what's th ha. User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : I g If it's weighted maybe. Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} 'Kay we're done designing. Industrial Designer : H it's got higher centre of gravity like that. Marketing : {vocalsound} Details, details. {vocalsound} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Come on. Marketing : Okay. So, is this a good-looking remote? {vocalsound} Would we wanna show it off to our friends? {vocalsound} User Interface : Three. You would though, 'cause it's bit {disfmarker} it's more interesting than other remotes. Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : I think, it was another colour and it was like {disfmarker} I think it'd look okay. I think maybe a two. Marketing : Yeah? Industrial Designer : I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that, Marketing : I mean I gue yeah, it's personal taste, but {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : Yeah. Industrial Designer : but definitely in another colour, I'm not happy with those colours. Marketing : Okay, so should we say two for that? Project Manager : Sure. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : Yeah? User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : Okay. Uh, question number five. What's um {disfmarker} will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy. User Interface : I think we have to market it in the right way, that um {disfmarker} to say that it is simplistic. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : Mm-hmm. User Interface : So people don't just see it and think, uh, this is so simplistic, I don't want to spend twenty five Euros. Project Manager : Yeah. User Interface : We have to market it. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : Yeah it {disfmarker} the marketing will have a lot to do with it. Industrial Designer : And {vocalsound} the kinetic energy, shaker-style-y, whoo, User Interface : And the kinetic energy part. Yeah. Project Manager : Yeah. {vocalsound} Durable. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : ooh no. {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Shake it and the buttons fall off. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} But you know, those'll be firmly on. User Interface : {vocalsound} Don't shake {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh no the plus. {vocalsound} You're Marketing : No, I guess, I don't know much about the remote control industry, how much your average sells for, User Interface : {disfmarker} use the zero. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Make a new one. Project Manager : But you're our Marketing Expert. {vocalsound} Marketing : but {disfmarker} I know I am, aren't I? User Interface : I think they're about ten po ten pound, aren't they? About ten pounds. Fifteen? Marketing : But you don't have to buy batteries. So in the long term this can actually save you money. Industrial Designer : Mm, yeah, that's true. User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : Oh. Exactly. Exactly. Marketing : So we'll market it that way too. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Good point. Marketing : So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options, it'll {disfmarker} User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah. I would give it a two still though. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Yeah. User Interface : Mm. Marketing : Yeah. Okay number six. Can someone read it out? Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user. Marketing : Or {disfmarker} Project Manager : Mm. User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : Um yeah. So that was mainly that the statistics {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah. User Interface : I think it does very well. Project Manager : Oh yeah. Industrial Designer : Because {disfmarker} Marketing : we said {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : yeah, because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing. User Interface : The zap {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : And it's just {disfmarker} you won't have to think about it. User Interface : yeah. Marketing : Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer : You don't have to look down to find them. Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : They're clearly there, easy to use. Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : Simple. User Interface : Uh {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} I think the key word there is average, 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : But they're not you and I really. Industrial Designer : Mm. Project Manager : Yeah. Marketing : So. Okay so one? Industrial Designer : Yeah. User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : Okay. Number seven. C Heather could you push it down? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly. Project Manager : We have the alarm system. Marketing : Now is there the {disfmarker} is the alarm system still {disfmarker} was it implemented? User Interface : Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system, the {vocalsound} lights {vocalsound} behind the {disfmarker} and it'll vibra {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : It {disfmarker} Yeah Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : l lights on and, or flash as well. But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm. User Interface : It'll be again in the marketing. Project Manager : I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up. User Interface : Yeah. The light {disfmarker} it will. Project Manager : Or or was it gonna make a noise? Industrial Designer : Yeah. But when the alarm's not {disfmarker} User Interface : But {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : yeah. If you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : But both {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : {vocalsound} Project Manager : You press the button it makes a noise right? Marketing : {vocalsound} It turns into a duck and starts quacking. Industrial Designer : Yeah. User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : You could s {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah. Awesome. Awesome. Industrial Designer : Yeah. {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh, that would be brilliant. Marketing : Here I am. User Interface : I'd be tempted to {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Well the thing is, if it was {disfmarker} had an alarm system, Marketing : {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : I mean, when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went. But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something, there wouldn't be any point. User Interface : Yeah. Industrial Designer : So you can't see the alarm, but it would light up. User Interface : It would have to be in the market Project Manager : I though w it was gonna make a noise. Marketing : Okay. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Alarm, User Interface : Yeah but you still couldn't see it. Industrial Designer : but you can't see an alarm inside uh {disfmarker} the alarm system itself. User Interface : It would just be a little speaker on the back or something. Project Manager : Okay. Marketing : We {disfmarker} oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Yeah. It w yeah. Marketing : But yeah, it'll be there. Project Manager : Oh okay. Marketing : So we can {disfmarker} we could say that { Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"

What is the primary concern of the marketing team regarding remote controls, What is the design philosophy of the industrial designer, Who is responsible for creating the user interface, What is the main advantage of a touch screen design, What is the trade-off between size and functionality, How can a remote control be made more multifunctional, What is the risk of having too many buttons on a remote control, Can a touch screen remote control already exist, What is the potential benefit of a touch screen remote control, What is the role of the project manager in the design process, How can the design of a remote control be simplified"
1023,"Marketing : Well , it's {disfmarker} this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the {disfmarker} about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . Industrial Designer : Mm .

User Interface : Sound signal . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Okay , User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : go on . Industrial Designer : Yes . Marketing : Well , I just said that . And uh {disfmarker} well , this obvious , and he also said it . Project Manager : Okay . So that's what the market tells us . Marketing : Uh that's about it , yes . Project Manager : Yep . Okay . User Interface : The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . Marketing : Uh mo uh zap buttons most . User Interface : So {disfmarker} Marketing : Volume , they are {gap} uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah , well it should just have a design {disfmarker} The perfect design for those {disfmarker} only those buttons . And first um {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yes . Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Well , the technical uh {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal . User Interface : Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering , {vocalsound} the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? Industrial Designer : Well Marketing : Yeah , that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a problem . Yeah . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yes . {vocalsound} Th that's a bit of {disfmarker} that's a problem . User Interface : {vocalsound} Another device is not a solution .

Industrial Designer : Oh yes . User Interface : Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it . Industrial Designer : Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button .

Industrial Designer : And um {disfmarker} User Interface : just like uh the phones Yeah , Industrial Designer : Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing . User Interface : the {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : But uh th User Interface : But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : No , so we we should use something else .

Industrial Designer : which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time . Project Manager : Yeah .

1031,"Marketing : I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo {vocalsound} everyone will s will buy it . User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Actually I'm not so sure Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} So if we go with just the {disfmarker} User Interface : because I'm the {disfmarker} Marketing : I'm sure . User Interface : you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm {disfmarker} instead of pressing up on on a remote control . You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay so {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Well it depends if it's a remote control th Marketing : it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that . User Interface : Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion . Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be {gap} . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now . Industrial Designer : Alright . Project Manager : Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said . We are targeting T_V_ . {vocalsound} We need {vocalsound} we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . Um we have {disfmarker} Marketing : With a good shape for the {disfmarker} Project Manager : or good shape , yes . We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . Maybe this is something we can stick to it . And um {vocalsound} also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the {disfmarker} one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ {vocalsound} and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ . Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ {disfmarker} in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback {disfmarker} to to give some feedback informations about what we could have . User Interface : Well it depends though {disfmarker} well it depends . If we we don't {disfmarker} unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that . Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of {disfmarker} something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus . So that's an extra Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah that's right . Don don't you ha User Interface : cost . Project Manager : don't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or {gap} well systems that exist that we can use ? User Interface : Well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote . Are we still {disfmarker} you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ? Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : 'Cause that really makes a big difference . 'Cause {vocalsound} even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s . It's just there are too many T_V_s out there . It's it's not really gonna {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah . That's good point . What's what cou what could be the cost of uh {disfmarker} well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ? User Interface : For twenty five Euro ? {vocalsound} I think it's impossible . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : It's not possible . It's impossible . User Interface : But but I dunno , Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that {disfmarker} any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh Marketing : Uh {disfmarker} User Interface : of increasing the unit price . Project Manager : {vocalsound} So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is {disfmarker} which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um {disfmarker} in terms to had {disfmarker} to have really an added value ? Marketing : What would be {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah Project Manager : Okay , User Interface : because {disfmarker} yeah . Project Manager : so regarding the automatic speech recognition , I think this is {disfmarker} Marketing : Wha but what would be {disfmarker} one question , what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ? User Interface : Well th Marketing : What what kind of information ? User Interface : 'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . Marketing : Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the Project Manager : They have tele teletext . Well , because they have teletext on it . Marketing : the n Project Manager : Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel . Marketing : Yeah but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays . Project Manager : They have t most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid {disfmarker} well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : So to to uh User Interface : You can get a lot more information on it . Project Manager : to browse more easily the teletext . For instance through uh through your remote control . Marketing : So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ? User Interface : So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to . Project Manager : The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes you could have uh {disfmarker} o User Interface : You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something Marketing : Okay . User Interface : so you can quickly just kind of {disfmarker} even without reading {disfmarker} Project Manager : Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext , also . User Interface : Well no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there . They may not have pictures , but maybe they do . Industrial Designer : Are {disfmarker} User Interface : There's {disfmarker} dependi it also depends on the country . Project Manager : Well because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for the same reason that we cannot uh {gap} informations on the T_V_ {gap} . We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there . User Interface : No but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . Uh . Project Manager : So {disfmarker} so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to {disfmarker} Marketing : But {disfmarker} Yeah . User Interface : Well I I think if we're gonna {disfmarker} I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the T_V_ . Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : I dunno . We need to find that out . Project Manager : Okay . {vocalsound} We need to close the meeting . Um {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : But {vocalsound} just a small thing , Project Manager : Very quickly . Industrial Designer : what kind of market we are targeting ? Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or {disfmarker} because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself . Project Manager : No . Industrial Designer : That is very important . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : Yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their {gap} , User Interface : If it's a really small T_V_ maybe {vocalsound} . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Broke . Okay . Okay . Project Manager : and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have . Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . Project Manager : So this is {disfmarker} that we z that that we should target . So the com the um {vocalsound} the uh {vocalsound} the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology . The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : It is up to you to go through this um {vocalsound} uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . So Marketing : I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the {disfmarker} than the L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ . Project Manager : Yeah , but not sure . Maybe it's cheaper , but we have no {disfmarker} Marketing : Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements . You need a internet connection . You need m more things . User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : But User Interface : Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop Marketing : for the speech recognition you you don't need anything .

User Interface : Well this is what we need to find out . Marketing : it's {disfmarker} User Interface : Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? 'Cause otherwise we need {disfmarker} Project Manager : Okay this is {gap} {disfmarker} this is an open question for you . Yeah . This is uh up to you to tell us . But I'm definitely not keen on to to {disfmarker} Marketing : To move to another target ?

Document: Marketing : I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo {vocalsound} everyone will s will buy it. User Interface : {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Actually I'm not so sure Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} So if we go with just the {disfmarker} User Interface : because I'm the {disfmarker} Marketing : I'm sure. User Interface : you know if I was using a remote control to, say, turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well, I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm {disfmarker} instead of pressing up on on a remote control. You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear, I'm trying to actually find out what's being said, Project Manager : Yeah. User Interface : so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay so {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons, it's about {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Well it depends if it's a remote control th Marketing : it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour, or something like that. User Interface : Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore, that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion. Marketing : {vocalsound} User Interface : If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it, then that could be {gap}. Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Okay gentlemens, we have to take some deci decisions right now. Industrial Designer : Alright. Project Manager : Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said. We are targeting T_V_. {vocalsound} We need {vocalsound} we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy, which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small, not too big. Um we have {disfmarker} Marketing : With a good shape for the {disfmarker} Project Manager : or good shape, yes. We should bring new technologies for young peoples, and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet. Maybe this is something we can stick to it. And um {vocalsound} also, a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the {disfmarker} one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate. So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price, it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ {vocalsound} and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies. Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_. Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ {disfmarker} in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback {disfmarker} to to give some feedback informations about what we could have. User Interface : Well it depends though {disfmarker} well it depends. If we we don't {disfmarker} unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that. Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there, but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of {disfmarker} something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus. So that's an extra Project Manager : {vocalsound} Yeah that's right. Don don't you ha User Interface : cost. Project Manager : don't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or {gap} well systems that exist that we can use? User Interface : Well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote. Are we still {disfmarker} you say we're focusing on T_V_, but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control, or is this something for our own line of of televisions? Project Manager : Yeah. User Interface : 'Cause that really makes a big difference. 'Cause {vocalsound} even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s. It's just there are too many T_V_s out there. It's it's not really gonna {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah. That's good point. What's what cou what could be the cost of uh {disfmarker} well, could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control? User Interface : For twenty five Euro? {vocalsound} I think it's impossible. Project Manager : Yeah. Industrial Designer : It's not possible. It's impossible. User Interface : But but I dunno, Marketing : Yeah. User Interface : I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that {disfmarker} any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control, and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics. So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh Marketing : Uh {disfmarker} User Interface : of increasing the unit price. Project Manager : {vocalsound} So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is {disfmarker} which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um {disfmarker} in terms to had {disfmarker} to have really an added value? Marketing : What would be {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Project Manager : Okay, User Interface : because {disfmarker} yeah. Project Manager : so regarding the automatic speech recognition, I think this is {disfmarker} Marketing : Wha but what would be {disfmarker} one question, what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control? User Interface : Well th Marketing : What what kind of information? User Interface : 'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers, like an interactive programme guide. Marketing : Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the Project Manager : They have tele teletext. Well, because they have teletext on it. Marketing : the n Project Manager : Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel. Marketing : Yeah but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays. Project Manager : They have t most of them have teletext, but we want to get rid {disfmarker} well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet. Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : So to to uh User Interface : You can get a lot more information on it. Project Manager : to browse more easily the teletext. For instance through uh through your remote control. Marketing : So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_? User Interface : So you could have the name of the programme, you could have um the start time you know where it's up to. Project Manager : The ti the start time, all the p all the programmes you could have uh {disfmarker} o User Interface : You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something Marketing : Okay. User Interface : so you can quickly just kind of {disfmarker} even without reading {disfmarker} Project Manager : Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext, also. User Interface : Well no, but there are the electronic programme guides out there. They may not have pictures, but maybe they do. Industrial Designer : Are {disfmarker} User Interface : There's {disfmarker} dependi it also depends on the country. Project Manager : Well because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for the same reason that we cannot uh {gap} informations on the T_V_ {gap}. We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there. User Interface : No but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from. So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that. Uh. Project Manager : So {disfmarker} so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control, if you want to browse, in addition to the T_V_, or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to {disfmarker} Marketing : But {disfmarker} Yeah. User Interface : Well I I think if we're gonna {disfmarker} I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control, especially if we don't control the T_V_. Project Manager : {vocalsound} User Interface : I dunno. We need to find that out. Project Manager : Okay. {vocalsound} We need to close the meeting. Um {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : But {vocalsound} just a small thing, Project Manager : Very quickly. Industrial Designer : what kind of market we are targeting? Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market, or what? So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or {disfmarker} because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself. Project Manager : No. Industrial Designer : That is very important. User Interface : Mm. Project Manager : Yeah, well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their {gap}, User Interface : If it's a really small T_V_ maybe {vocalsound}. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Broke. Okay. Okay. Project Manager : and they want to go t for universal one, and they take the fanciest they can have. Industrial Designer : Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Project Manager : So this is {disfmarker} that we z that that we should target. So the com the um {vocalsound} the uh {vocalsound} the committment is the following, we don't go for speech recognition technology. The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion. Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : It is up to you to go through this um {vocalsound} uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting. So Marketing : I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the {disfmarker} than the L_C_D_. Industrial Designer : It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_. Project Manager : Yeah, but not sure. Maybe it's cheaper, but we have no {disfmarker} Marketing : Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements. You need a internet connection. You need m more things. User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : But User Interface : Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop Marketing : for the speech recognition you you don't need anything. You just say channel fifty, and that's it. User Interface : I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe, or a {disfmarker} you know. Marketing : But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars, Industrial Designer : Means th yeah twenty five Euros is {disfmarker} yeah, that's right. User Interface : Well this is what we need to find out. Marketing : it's {disfmarker} User Interface : Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control? 'Cause otherwise we need {disfmarker} Project Manager : Okay this is {gap} {disfmarker} this is an open question for you. Yeah. This is uh up to you to tell us. But I'm definitely not keen on to to {disfmarker} Marketing : To move to another target? Project Manager : no no no, I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies. I'm not confident enough. I'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work.

Professor E : i it couldn't {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} Of non - digits . Grad C : Yeah , absolutely . I mean , the digits don't take up that much time . Professor E : Yeah , yeah . OK .

The next step is to {disfmarker} that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized .

Postdoc F : So if you just say "" nine two "" , the {disfmarker} there are many s ways that could have been expressed . An - and I just had them {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things . PhD B : You know , Jane ? Grad C : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in {disfmarker} in order to build lexicons and things , if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , {comment} a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of {pause} inconsistencies and mis Grad C : Misspelled . PhD A : Yeah . Postdoc F : You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too . Y you mean just uh {pause} on each {disfmarker} on each line there 's a one word right ? It 's one token from the {disfmarker} from the corpus . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Postdoc F : Yeah , those are e extremely efficient and I and I {disfmarker} I agree that 's a very good use of it . PhD B : Oh so you already have that , OK . Postdoc F : Well that 's {disfmarker} that 's a way {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} You know , the spell - check basically does that but {disfmarker} but in addition {disfmarker} yes , that 's {disfmarker} that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh , Postdoc F : Exactly . And then you ca then you can do a s PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and {disfmarker} and so it makes it easier . Postdoc F : Absolutely . I agree . That 's a very good {disfmarker} that 's a very good uh , suggestion . And that was {disfmarker} that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed . I didn't get to that point but {disfmarker} So there are numbers , then there are acronyms , and then um , there 's a {disfmarker} he she wants the uh , actually a {disfmarker} an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either "" VOC "" for vocalized , like cough or like laugh or whatever , "" NONVOC "" for door - slam , and "" GLOSS "" for things that have to do with {disfmarker} if they said a s a spoken form with this {disfmarker} m this pronunciation error . Grad C : Right . Postdoc F : I already had that convention PhD B : Oh that 's great . Postdoc F : but I {disfmarker} I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most {disfmarker} ha most efficiently handled by uh {disfmarker} by a {disfmarker} a filter . That was what I was always planing on . So that , you know you get a whole long list {disfmarker} exactly what you 're saying , you get a whole list of things that say "" curly bracket laugh curly bracket "" , PhD B : Mm - hmm . Postdoc F : then y you know it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space , PhD B : Yeah .

Postdoc F : you end up with a s with uh , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens PhD B : Mm - hmm . Postdoc F : and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes .

Postdoc F : Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um {pause} and PLP is clear but uh there are things that are not so well known , in {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or have variant {disfmarker} u u uses like the numbers you can say "" nine two "" or you can say "" ninety - two "" , Grad C : So how are you doing the {disfmarker} Postdoc F : and uh I 'd handle the numbers individually . Grad C : How are you doing the uh , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ? Postdoc F : It would be separate {disfmarker} The letters would be separated in space Grad C : OK .

1064,"PhD C : Um Well , I {disfmarker} I sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with Andreas ' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams {disfmarker} a bigram recognizer and that 's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations . Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who {disfmarker} Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and um {vocalsound} you know separated {disfmarker} used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used and uh Don sampled that so {disfmarker} so eight K um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes , up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that {disfmarker} that 's twenty minutes or so ? Um yeah because I guess there 's some , Grad E : Or so . PhD C : and Don can talk to Jane about this , there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh I 'm {disfmarker} we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier . Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually Grad E : Hmm . PhD C : um Grad E : I {disfmarker} was that {disfmarker} did that {disfmarker} did that recording have the glitch in the middle ? Postdoc G : I 'm puzzled by that . I {disfmarker} oh {disfmarker} oh , I see . PhD C : There 's {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} Postdoc G : Oh there was a glitch somewhere . PhD C : yeah , so that actually um Grad F : Was it twenty minutes in , PhD C : if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know Postdoc G : I forgot about that . Grad F : I thought {disfmarker} PhD A : Well it was interesting , Postdoc G : Well , I mean , they {disfmarker} PhD A : suddenly {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent Grad E : I don't remember when it is . Postdoc G : but I was able to can transcribe PhD A : but i looking at {disfmarker} the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the {disfmarker} it was actually recognized PhD C : Wel Grad E : Oh no . Grad F : Yeah , that might be {disfmarker} that might be {disfmarker} that might be my fault . Postdoc G : Wow . PhD A : so Grad E : Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch . Grad F : I 'm not {disfmarker} PhD A : OK . PhD C : No actually it was {disfmarker} yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um Grad F : yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time , Postdoc G : Oh . That 's not good . PhD C : Yeah PhD A : OK . PhD C : so that 's what we have Grad E : Alright . Grad F : so PhD C : but that {disfmarker} that will be completely gone if this synch time problem Postdoc G : Yeah . Grad E : The {disfmarker} the glitch PhD A : So {disfmarker} so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to Postdoc G : And the only glitch {disfmarker} Grad E : yeah . Postdoc G : yeah . PhD C : So you guys know . Professor B : S sorry I haven't seen the email , PhD C : Yeah . Grad E : Th - the Postdoc G : The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} wait Professor B : what was the score ? PhD C : So here 's the actual copy of the email Postdoc G : we should say something about the glitch . He {disfmarker} he can say something about the glitch . PhD C : um oh OK Grad E : yeah . Postdoc G : Cuz it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} h it 's {disfmarker} it 's very small {disfmarker} PhD C : so does this glitch occur at other {disfmarker} Grad E : There {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized Postdoc G : very small . Yep . PhD C : Oh . PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : Right . Grad E : so the {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second Professor B : Hmm . Grad F : Hmm . Grad E : and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing {disfmarker} doing click sounds . Professor B : So {disfmarker} PhD C : And is it only once that that happens ? Grad E : But yeah PhD C : OK . Grad E : it {disfmarker} right once in the middle . PhD C : There 's {disfmarker} the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong Professor B : so {disfmarker} so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice , PhD C : but Grad E : Um But that shouldn't affect anything PhD C : OK so that 's actually Postdoc G : S and it {disfmarker} Professor B : you see this here ? PhD C : It {disfmarker} y it 's {disfmarker} Grad E : yeah yeah "" bah "" PhD C : OK no {disfmarker} PhD A : Oh , and {disfmarker} PhD C : What happens is it actually affects the script that Don {disfmarker} PhD D : Huh . PhD C : I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it Grad E : Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything . PhD C : but they Grad F : Yeah , I don't know exactly what affected it Postdoc G : I agree . I agree . PhD A : I {disfmarker} I have {disfmarker} Grad F : but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to you about it , PhD A : Yeah . Grad E : But I {disfmarker} I do remember {disfmarker} PhD C : Yeah . Grad F : I 'll show you the point . Postdoc G : Yeah . It {disfmarker} it had no effect on my transcription , PhD A : Mmm . Postdoc G : you know , I mean I {disfmarker} I had no trouble hearing it and {disfmarker} and having time bins Grad E : I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect . Postdoc G : but there was a {disfmarker} Oh . PhD C : Well , the {disfmarker} the synch time {disfmarker} the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should , Grad F : That 's what happened . Postdoc G : Oh . PhD H : Yeah . Grad E : Where {disfmarker} where they weren't monotonic . Grad F : There was {disfmarker} yeah , I mean {disfmarker} PhD C : right ? There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame . PhD H : Yeah . Postdoc G : Oh , interesting . PhD C : And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right Grad E : Oh OK so that 's Grad F : Hmm . Postdoc G : Oh . PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : so anyway it 's {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker} Grad E : yeah sounds like a bug . Postdoc G : Yeah . PhD C : that 's why we only have twenty minutes but there 's a significant amount of {disfmarker} Grad F : Non - zero ? Um there are like more {disfmarker} cuz there 's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran , Grad E : The other one I saw was that it yeah . Grad F : I mean but there were there was a point . PhD C : Yeah that was fine . That {disfmarker} that was OK . Grad E : The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times Grad F : OK . Grad E : and that definitely indicra indicates a bug . Grad F : Uh . PhD C : Well that would really be a problem , yeah . So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting . Grad F : Yeah . PhD C : um and what 's {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} Grad E : So that 's very encouraging . PhD C : this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition , Professor B : Hmm . PhD H : Yeah . Professor B : Cool . PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this Trent Lott which PhD D : Trent Lott . PhD C : um I mean these are sort of funny ones , PhD D : It 'll get those though . PhD C : there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references , I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see Grad E : I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : but um it 's pretty good . Grad E : because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right ? PhD C : Well so I guess we can generate Grad E : Sounds likes ? PhD A : There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where {disfmarker} got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong . Postdoc G : Mm - hmm . PhD C : um Grad E : Yeah , and who cares ? And {disfmarker} and there were lots of {disfmarker} of course the "" uh uh "" - s , "" in on "" - s "" of uh "" - s . PhD A : Mmm , so if {disfmarker} PhD C : there 's {disfmarker} No those are actually PhD A : Yeah . PhD C : a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary , PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : so is it like PZM is three words , it 's PZM , PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : I mean there 's nothing There 's no language model for PZM or Grad E : Right . Ri - ri right . PhD C : um Grad E : Did you say there 's no language for PZM ? PhD C : No language model , I mean those {disfmarker} Grad E : Do you mean {disfmarker} so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ? Maybe we shouldn't say PZM in these meetings . PhD C : Well {disfmarker} well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and I mean um anyway there {disfmarker} Grad E : Yeah , that 's right , Jimlet . Professor B : Well , we don't even know what that means , PhD C : so {vocalsound} but this is really encouraging because Professor B : so I Grad E : Yeah , that 's right . PhD C : so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of {disfmarker} of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained {disfmarker} mostly trained recognizer Grad E : Right . PhD C : and Switchboard - two is {disfmarker} got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic Grad E : Excellent . PhD C : and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that 's great . Professor B : Yeah . Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did {disfmarker} had the ninety - three workshop PhD C : Um Professor B : and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : Oh yeah Professor B : you know PhD C : I mean this is really , PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : and thanks to Andreas who , I mean this is a PhD A : Mmm .

But this is {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the technology . It 's actually a little bit thinner than this . And it 's two by two , by one , and it would fit right under the {disfmarker} right under th the the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the lip , Grad A : Yeah , does everyone know about the lip on the table ? It 's great . Undergrad D : yeah . There 's a lip in these tables . Postdoc E : Nice . Undergrad D : And , it oc I p especially brought the bottom along to try and generate some frequencies that you may not already have recorded . Grad A : Clink ! Clink ! Undergrad D : Let 's see {disfmarker} {vocalsound} see what it does to the {disfmarker} But this was the uh {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just to review , and I also brought this {comment} along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table , and sort of w push them around .

Undergrad D : That {disfmarker} that 's the six tables that we 're looking at . These six tables here , {vocalsound} with {disfmarker} with little boxes sort of , uh , in the middle here . PhD B : I see . Postdoc E : OK . Undergrad D : Which es would {disfmarker} I mean , the {disfmarker} the boxes are pretty much out of the way anyway . I 'll - I 'll show you the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the cro this is the table cross section . I don't know if people realize what they 're looking at . PhD B : You trying to {pause} screw up the m the microphones ? Grad A : Yes . He is . Absolutely . PhD B : I mean th Undergrad D : Well why not ? I mean , cuz this is what 's gonna happen . You got plenty of data . I won't come to your next meeting . And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and you So this is the box 's {disfmarker} Grad A : Get your paper off my PDA ! PhD B : Yeah . Postdoc E : Yeah , let {disfmarker} let the record show that this is exhibit two B . Undergrad D : That 's right . "" Or not to be "" . Yeah , yeah . Grad A : Yeah . Undergrad D : Uh , the box , uh {disfmarker} there 's a half inch lip here . The box is an inch thick so it hangs down a half an inch . And so the {disfmarker} the two {vocalsound} head set jacks would be in the front and then the little LED to indicate that that box is live . The {disfmarker} the important issue about the LED is the fact that we 're talking about eight of these total , which would be sixteen channels . And , uh , even though we have sixteen channels back at the capture , they 're not all gonna be used for this . PhD B : Hmm . Undergrad D : So there 'd be a subset of them used for {disfmarker} obviously j just use the ones at this end for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for this many . So {disfmarker} Excuse me . you 'd like a {disfmarker} a way to tell whether your box is live , so the LED wouldn't be on . PhD B : Right . All the lights . Undergrad D : So if you 're plugged in it doesn't work and the LED is off that 's {disfmarker} that 's a tip off . And then the , uh {disfmarker} would wire the {disfmarker} all of the cables in a {disfmarker} in a bundle come through here and o obviously collect these cables at the same time .

Undergrad D : Uh , so this {disfmarker} this notion of putting down the P Z Ms {vocalsound} and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table Grad A : Right . Well , we wanna do that definitely . Undergrad D : or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} Right . Grad A : So . Undergrad D : Right . And so the {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} we just epoxy them down or something . Big screw into the table . PhD B : Velcro . Undergrad D : Uh , and even though there 's eight cables they 're not really very big around so my model is to get a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a p piece of {disfmarker} Grad A : Sleeve . Undergrad D : yeah , that {disfmarker} that stuff that people put with the little {disfmarker} you slip the wires into that 's {vocalsound} sort of shaped like that cross section . Grad A : Oh .

Grad A : OK , so that {disfmarker} Undergrad D : s So it would c basically go on the diagonal here . PhD C : It could go either way . Grad A : So why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number ? PhD B : Yeah . PhD C : I guess . Undergrad D : Uh , because the {disfmarker} PhD B : How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables ? Undergrad D : Because they 're there . Grad A : Well , OK , let me rephrase that . Why two each ? PhD B : Oh , because then you don't have to just have one each . So that if t if you have two people sitting next to each other they can actually go into the same box .

Grad A : Right . N none of these and no P Z Ms then . Undergrad D : Yeah . Right . Right . I agree . PhD B : Only if you had {disfmarker} Well it depends on this box , right ? Undergrad D : Oh , true enough . And actually , at the m my plan is to only bring eight wires out of this box . PhD B : Exactly . Grad A : Oh , I didn't understand {disfmarker} Undergrad D : This {disfmarker} this box {disfmarker} Thi - thi thi this box is a one off deal . Postdoc E : That being the wiring box . Grad A : Oh , I see , I see . Undergrad D : Uh . And , uh , it 's function is to s to , uh , essentially a wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires , plus supply power to the microphones cuz the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} he the , uh , cheap head mounteds all require low voltage . Grad A : So {disfmarker} so you 'd imagine some sort of {disfmarker} in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each d of these two and each of those one or what ?

Undergrad D : So {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} that was the whole issue with the LED , that you plug it in , the LED comes on , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and you 're live .

Undergrad D : d we {disfmarker} we out of tape {disfmarker} out of disk? PhD B : No, we're doing {disfmarker} we're doing great. Undergrad D : I {disfmarker} I was looking for the actual box I plan to use, uh, but I {disfmarker} c all I could {disfmarker} I couldn't find it at the local store. But this is {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the technology. It's actually a little bit thinner than this. And it's two by two, by one, and it would fit right under the {disfmarker} right under th the the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the lip, Grad A : Yeah, does everyone know about the lip on the table? It's great. Undergrad D : yeah. There's a lip in these tables. Postdoc E : Nice. Undergrad D : And, it oc I p especially brought the bottom along to try and generate some frequencies that you may not already have recorded. Grad A : Clink! Clink! Undergrad D : Let's see {disfmarker} {vocalsound} see what it does to the {disfmarker} But this was the uh {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just to review, and I also brought this {comment} along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table, and sort of w push them around. Grad A : And {disfmarker} and crinkle them and {disfmarker} PhD B : What? Postdoc E : And th "" that "" being a diagram. PhD B : What? Undergrad D : That {disfmarker} that's the six tables that we're looking at. These six tables here, {vocalsound} with {disfmarker} with little boxes sort of, uh, in the middle here. PhD B : I see. Postdoc E : OK. Undergrad D : Which es would {disfmarker} I mean, the {disfmarker} the boxes are pretty much out of the way anyway. I 'll - I 'll show you the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the cro this is the table cross section. I don't know if people realize what they're looking at. PhD B : You trying to {pause} screw up the m the microphones? Grad A : Yes. He is. Absolutely. PhD B : I mean th Undergrad D : Well why not? I mean, cuz this is what's gonna happen. You got plenty of data. I won't come to your next meeting. And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and you So this is the box's {disfmarker} Grad A : Get your paper off my PDA! PhD B : Yeah. Postdoc E : Yeah, let {disfmarker} let the record show that this is exhibit two B. Undergrad D : That's right. "" Or not to be "". Yeah, yeah. Grad A : Yeah. Undergrad D : Uh, the box, uh {disfmarker} there's a half inch lip here. The box is an inch thick so it hangs down a half an inch. And so the {disfmarker} the two {vocalsound} head set jacks would be in the front and then the little LED to indicate that that box is live. The {disfmarker} the important issue about the LED is the fact that we're talking about eight of these total, which would be sixteen channels. And, uh, even though we have sixteen channels back at the capture, they're not all gonna be used for this. PhD B : Hmm. Undergrad D : So there 'd be a subset of them used for {disfmarker} obviously j just use the ones at this end for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for this many. So {disfmarker} Excuse me. you 'd like a {disfmarker} a way to tell whether your box is live, so the LED wouldn't be on. PhD B : Right. All the lights. Undergrad D : So if you're plugged in it doesn't work and the LED is off that's {disfmarker} that's a tip off. And then the, uh {disfmarker} would wire the {disfmarker} all of the cables in a {disfmarker} in a bundle come through here and o obviously collect these cables at the same time. Postdoc E : That's good. Undergrad D : Uh, so this {disfmarker} this notion of putting down the P Z Ms {vocalsound} and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table Grad A : Right. Well, we wanna do that definitely. Undergrad D : or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} Right. Grad A : So. Undergrad D : Right. And so the {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} we just epoxy them down or something. Big screw into the table. PhD B : Velcro. Undergrad D : Uh, and even though there's eight cables they're not really very big around so my model is to get a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a p piece of {disfmarker} Grad A : Sleeve. Undergrad D : yeah, that {disfmarker} that stuff that people put with the little {disfmarker} you slip the wires into that's {vocalsound} sort of shaped like that cross section. Grad A : Oh. OK, not just sleeve them all? Undergrad D : Yeah. I'm {disfmarker} I'm r a I'm going up and then I'm going down. Grad A : And leave them loose? PhD B : No. Postdoc E : That looks like a semi - circle. PhD B : Yeah. It's like a {disfmarker} it's a sleeping policeman. Grad A : Whoo! PhD B : Speed bump!

Professor B : Right? Grad D : OK. Professor B : That are going into the main f file server. PhD E : OK. Professor B : So. PhD C : Markham's ordering and they should be coming in soon. Grad D : W Well. So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} Grad F : Soon? Grad D : Yeah. I mean, I guess the thing is is, all I need is to hang it off, like, {vocalsound} the person who's coming in, Sonali's, computer. PhD H : Oh, so {disfmarker} so, you mean the d the internal {disfmarker} the disks on the machines that we just got? Grad D : Whew. Or we can move them. Grad F : No. PhD C : These are gonna go onto Abbott. Grad F : Ne - new disks. PhD H : Or extra disk? Professor B : Onto Abbott, the file server. Grad D : So are we gonna move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in? Grad F : On {disfmarker} PhD H : Oh, oh. OK. Grad F : Yeah. PhD E : Uh, i Grad F : Once they come in. Sure. Grad D : OK. That's fine. PhD E : Do {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when is this planned for {pause} roughly? PhD C : They should be {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I imagine next week or something. Grad D : OK. PhD E : OK. So {disfmarker} Grad F : If you're {disfmarker} if you're desperate, I have some space on my drive. Grad D : I think if I'm {disfmarker} Grad F : But I {disfmarker} I vacillate between no space free and {pause} a few gig free. Grad D : Yeah. I think I can find something if I'm desperate PhD E : Yeah. Grad F : So. Grad D : and, um, in the meantime I 'll just hold out. Grad F : OK. Grad D : That was the only thing I wanted to bring up. PhD C : It should be soon. We {disfmarker} we should {disfmarker} Grad D : OK. Professor B : So there's another hundred gig. So. Grad D : Alright. Great. PhD H : Mm - hmm. Professor B : OK. It's great to be able to do it, Grad D : That's it. Professor B : just say "" oh yeah, a hundred gig, PhD E : Good. Professor B : no big deal "". Grad D : Yeah. Grad F : Yeah. A hundred gig here, a hundred gig there. PhD E : Well, each meeting is like a gig or something, Grad F : It's eventually real disk space. Professor B : Yeah. PhD E : so it's really {disfmarker} Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"

Project Manager : and there are different screen shots , so {disfmarker} or different different screens , Industrial Designer : Well I dra Marketing : Ah , okay , cool . Industrial Designer : uh Danny , Danny , I'll do that , Marketing : Huh ? Yeah ? Oh , yea yeah , you design it . Um {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : because I draw the uh Project Manager : so {disfmarker} User Interface : We've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries . Marketing : {vocalsound} Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , huh ? Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ? User Interface : Yeah . I would do a battery {disfmarker} we do . Right ? Marketing : Solar cell . No Project Manager : We'll wait . User Interface : A battery . One battery , Industrial Designer : No , no solar cell , no no no no . Marketing : it took a battery ? User Interface : right ? Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : No hand dynamo . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : {vocalsound} Electronics , simple chip {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Hand {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Marketing : We have {disfmarker} User Interface : advanced chip , right ? Marketing : No , we have sample speaker . Industrial Designer : On advanced chip . Marketing : But b al but we also have sample speaker , do User Interface : Yeah , Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . User Interface : so this one and this one . Uh we ha we have um single {disfmarker} Marketing : Oh , we already on nine . User Interface : what ? Are we ? Oh yay . Marketing : We have double curved . User Interface : {vocalsound} The single . Industrial Designer : Single nee single curved . Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . Marketing : Single . Industrial Designer : But it isn't three dimensional , User Interface : Oh the the {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : it isn't curved in a l Marketing : This one is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : it's not going to work uh people . We have rubber . Marketing : This one is curved like this , Project Manager : I'll just fill it in . Marketing : right . It's curved like this . Industrial Designer : No no no , Project Manager : Um rubber indeed ? Industrial Designer : single curved is like this . Uh that's the only curve you made , Marketing : Yeah , bu what {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : not th uh curved like that . That's uh {disfmarker} Marketing : Oh , but we have curves like it and it . User Interface : Thirteen ? Marketing : There are two curves , right ? Oh , okay I understand , I understand . User Interface : With a scroll wheel , Industrial Designer : Huh ? User Interface : right ? Is he integrated ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Rubber . User Interface : No , eh ? I don't know . Industrial Designer : Yeah , Marketing : Push button . No , we don't have push button . Industrial Designer : we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s User Interface : Oh yeah , right , we want it to {disfmarker} it's not it's not {disfmarker} no . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Not going to work ? Marketing : L_C_D_ display . User Interface : Yep . Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay um {disfmarker} User Interface : Fifteen , oh , too bad . {vocalsound} Oh but with special colour we have . A special form , right ? Industrial Designer : But now button supplements . We don't got the button supplements . User Interface : Oh , we don't have any buttons , so {disfmarker} Marketing : Eighteen and a half , User Interface : Yeah , we need to uh Marketing : damn . Industrial Designer : Damn . Marketing : We have to lower it with six points . User Interface : No , uh we have fifteen and {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : Twelve and half . User Interface : oh , right . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : We could lose the curve . Industrial Designer : Nah . Marketing : We could use {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah , I would lose the curve . Industrial Designer : We could lose the scroll wheel . You could make it just a regular scroll wheel . User Interface : But you can't push it , so you have to tap . Industrial Designer : Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh {vocalsound} with uh the button . User Interface : Yeah , alright . Project Manager : Yeah , I think that will be our best bet . User Interface : So normal scroll wheel ? Industrial Designer : Normal scroll wheel . User Interface : And I think we should lose the curve . Marketing : I think we should scrap the sample speaker . Industrial Designer : Lose {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Marketing : It's four pri it four units . User Interface : Yeah , but if you {disfmarker} would i it is a new feature , it it's something special . Industrial Designer : Okay , so we don't exactly need the single {disfmarker} We don't need a curve . Marketing : But w d wha User Interface : No , the curve doesn't really {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : 'S possible to lose curve . Marketing : Curved then it will be square . User Interface : No , then it will {disfmarker} won't uh stand up from the table . Then it would just {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Okay . {vocalsound} Marketing : Was that {disfmarker} does that mean to it , single curve ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's meant with scr uh with s curve . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : The curve is uh in a dimension . Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : If you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . User Interface : So {disfmarker} We would lose this one ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay . Marketing : Yeah , but tha that that only is one . User Interface : Yeah , we could s yeah , a bit . Industrial Designer : No , two . Marketing : No , one . User Interface : Sixteen point three . Industrial Designer : Oh , okay , indeed . Marketing : So we don't {disfmarker} User Interface : So we still {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah , we also have to {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Is it possible to make {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? Marketing : No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . User Interface : No ? Ma y you just can't do that , or uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : No . Project Manager : And what did you change ? You changed the uh scroll wheel User Interface : We changed th Project Manager : and {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah , and the single curved to uncurved . Marketing : Single curved . Project Manager : Oh , but it's just one Marketing : Flat . Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think {disfmarker} Project Manager : point , so maybe you should should uh {disfmarker} User Interface : No . Marketing : Scrap sample speaker ? Project Manager : Yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition . Industrial Designer : The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . Marketing : That that's uh {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah , but it's t Marketing : Yes , four points . Project Manager : And then you can keep the curve . User Interface : Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , Project Manager : Or can't you ? User Interface : it is something special . Industrial Designer : Yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? User Interface : I don't know . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : F You have to {disfmarker} we have to scrap four points . User Interface : Yeah , that's difficult . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Or make it on a hand dynamo , but {vocalsound} I don't think that will work . User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Marketing : Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? Industrial Designer : No , that's {disfmarker} no . User Interface : Uh . Industrial Designer : Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ? User Interface : {vocalsound} We could make it titanium instead of rubber . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} You don't make a remote control of {disfmarker} Ah . Marketing : Yeah , Project Manager : Yeah , Marketing : it it i Project Manager : mm-hmm . Marketing : Yeah , it also {disfmarker} uh it also takes one point less . Project Manager : Yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , User Interface : Oh . Oh can I ask something ? Project Manager : yes ? User Interface : What is special colour ? Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Is that the wood uh wood uh {disfmarker} Marketing : I think it is . User Interface : this , we have to have that one too ? Industrial Designer : It isn't . Project Manager : Yeah , Industrial Designer : What ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : but it's only a half . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . Marketing : Yeah . Sample speaker . Industrial Designer : To knock the sample speaker , yeah . And sample sensor . User Interface : Th then we still have too much Marketing : Yeah , okay , User Interface : if we use the uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : But m yeah , course , Marketing : three . Point three . Industrial Designer : but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah , we we scrap that one ? Industrial Designer : What we'll have . {vocalsound} Marketing : Huh ? Industrial Designer : Let's make it thirteen or fourteen . {vocalsound} User Interface : See , a po Marketing : Point twelve {gap} . User Interface : three . {vocalsound} We need point three . {vocalsound} Marketing : That's a scroll wheel . {vocalsound} User Interface : Uh it's a colour . Don't make it wood . Industrial Designer : A colour . Marketing : Yeah , but a wood {disfmarker} User Interface : Make it uh {disfmarker} Marketing : we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . User Interface : Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it a all kind of colours ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , special colours , fruity colours . User Interface : It's also green or uh {disfmarker} Marketing : Is it also {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : no that that's just normal colour {disfmarker} fruit colours . User Interface : Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . Marketing : Normal colours , yellow {disfmarker} User Interface : You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : You don't say here's green rubber . Industrial Designer : They don't sell green rubber plants . {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . Industrial Designer : Alright . User Interface : Yeah , you can , you should {disfmarker} you have to lose {disfmarker} Marketing : But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh User Interface : No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess . Industrial Designer : No no no . Marketing : s advanced chip . No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? Industrial Designer : If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen Marketing : Five ? Then we have two . User Interface : A push , Marketing : S User Interface : yeah . Marketing : touch . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} then it's possible to make . And then you can {vocalsound} and then you can add to the colours . Marketing : Then we can make {disfmarker} add two colours on it . Yeah , two colours {gap} it . Industrial Designer : Special c User Interface : Switch colours . Industrial Designer : Okay , if you lose uh {vocalsound} if you lose the {disfmarker} User Interface : It was such a great idea . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : You lose this one , you got eleven point five Marketing : They can add two colours . Industrial Designer : and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example . Marketing : But the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : How d uh uh how many colours ? User Interface : What do you mean ? Industrial Designer : Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p Marketing : Yeah , but we we we are {disfmarker} we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . Industrial Designer : Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour . User Interface : Oh . Marketing : Ah okay . User Interface : But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , Industrial Designer : I suppose . User Interface : 'cause you have to add it . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . User Interface : Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . You co you could make it always black , like normal remote . Marketing : Yeah b Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow {disfmarker} uh red , and then you add {disfmarker} you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . Industrial Designer : Nee we we also want to make ano another colour . User Interface : Oh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u Marketing : Yeah , but m User Interface : Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . Marketing : Yeah , User Interface : That's what it means . Marketing : because we have more colours than only black . Project Manager : Yeah , but isn't it per remote that you pay ? User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : I {disfmarker} then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special {disfmarker} Project Manager : Half ? User Interface : Oh right , yeah . Is it per remote ? Project Manager : I think you pay half per remote . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah , that's right , Project Manager : So each remote with a special colour . User Interface : and you {disfmarker} one colour per remote . Industrial Designer : Yeah , indeed , yeah . User Interface : So then it is one . Industrial Designer : You don't need four of those {vocalsound} uh four of those special colours in one in one remote . Marketing : Yeah , okay okay , true . True , true . User Interface : No . Project Manager : I hope . {vocalsound} Marketing : We have two points spare . Project Manager : So the battery , Marketing : Nee one point . Project Manager : we have um advanced chip on print . User Interface : One . So it would be curved , single curve . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Because of {disfmarker} thing {disfmarker} User Interface : Or not ? Project Manager : Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again . Industrial Designer : Hmm . User Interface : So y you just can't make a nice remote . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah , single curve . Project Manager : Because that was very important , User Interface : It's too bad for the speaker . Project Manager : huh ? So it's curved , it's still that {disfmarker} so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . User Interface : Should we change that tha that that's a one if not , Marketing : Mm yep . Project Manager : We dropped the scroll wheel . User Interface : or not ? Could you copy it ? Project Manager : And the rest is the same , User Interface : And make it uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : huh ? Am I right ? Marketing : Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : The entire uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Uh . Huh . Marketing : Yep . User Interface : Perhaps you can then copy page or so . Ooh . No . Oh you you made the entire {disfmarker} could you {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Okay . Undo , undo . {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Oh Industrial Designer : Undo . User Interface : not {disfmarker} Well {gap} . Industrial Designer : So , 'kay . User Interface : Would you ? Industrial Designer : Twenty minutes ? User Interface : By the {disfmarker} Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . Add it copy page . Select all . Project Manager : No , but you c yeah .

Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : Yeah, but the rubbers alls original black. User Interface : Yeah, so you always lose the special colour. You co you could make it always black, like normal remote. Marketing : Yeah b Yeah, but we're gonna make it yellow {disfmarker} uh red, and then you add {disfmarker} you have two special colours on top of the one we have now. Industrial Designer : Nee we we also want to make ano another colour. User Interface : Oh right, yeah. Yeah, we should u Marketing : Yeah, but m User Interface : Yeah. We have to make this like four or five or something. Marketing : Yeah, User Interface : That's what it means. Marketing : because we have more colours than only black. Project Manager : Yeah, but isn't it per remote that you pay? User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : I {disfmarker} then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special {disfmarker} Project Manager : Half? User Interface : Oh right, yeah. Is it per remote? Project Manager : I think you pay half per remote. User Interface : Yeah. Yeah, that's right, Project Manager : So each remote with a special colour. User Interface : and you {disfmarker} one colour per remote. Industrial Designer : Yeah, indeed, yeah. User Interface : So then it is one. Industrial Designer : You don't need four of those {vocalsound} uh four of those special colours in one in one remote. Marketing : Yeah, okay okay, true. True, true. User Interface : No. Project Manager : I hope. {vocalsound} Marketing : We have two points spare. Project Manager : So the battery, Marketing : Nee one point. Project Manager : we have um advanced chip on print. User Interface : One. So it would be curved, single curve. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Because of {disfmarker} thing {disfmarker} User Interface : Or not? Project Manager : Yeah, well you can at least make it curved again. Industrial Designer : Hmm. User Interface : So y you just can't make a nice remote. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : Yeah, single curve. Project Manager : Because that was very important, User Interface : It's too bad for the speaker. Project Manager : huh? So it's curved, it's still that {disfmarker} so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker. User Interface : Should we change that tha that that's a one if not, Marketing : Mm yep. Project Manager : We dropped the scroll wheel. User Interface : or not? Could you copy it? Project Manager : And the rest is the same, User Interface : And make it uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : huh? Am I right? Marketing : Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped. Project Manager : Yes. User Interface : The entire uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Uh. Huh. Marketing : Yep. User Interface : Perhaps you can then Questions: |eot_id|>assistant"
1124,"PhD F : We um {disfmarker} So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . And um , uh , we ordered uh , SUN - Blade - one - hundreds , and um , I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running {disfmarker} So the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running P - make and Customs here and Andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . And he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , {vocalsound} run things using P - make and Customs . You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that . The simplest thing {disfmarker} And I can send an email around or , maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something . Um , Professor C : How about an email that points to the FAQ , PhD F : there 's a c Professor C : you know what I 'm saying ? PhD F : Yeah , yeah . Professor C : so that you can {disfmarker} Yeah . PhD F : Uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called "" run command "" . "" Run dash command "" , "" run hyphen command "" . And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh {disfmarker} and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . So you can try this as a simple test with uh , the L S command . So you can say "" run dash command L S "" , and , um , it 'll actually export that {vocalsound} LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory . So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run , and um {disfmarker} And that 's a simple way to get started using {disfmarker} using this . And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , {vocalsound} um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . Now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it . Uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like "" run command "" , you can specify those attributes for your program . For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that . So . You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . So , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're {disfmarker} Uh .

Yeah , you know , I {disfmarker} I sort of got started {comment} using the recognizer just recently and uh , uh I fired off a training job , and then I fired off a recognition job and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , "" uh , are you running two {vocalsound} trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run .

Grad G : So , um , let 's say I have like , a thousand little {disfmarker} little jobs to do ? PhD F : Mm - hmm . Grad G : Um , how do I do it with "" run command "" ? I mean do {disfmarker} PhD F : You could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job Grad G : Uh - huh . A thousand times ? PhD F : right ? But you probably wanna be careful with that Grad G : OK . PhD F : because um , you don't wanna saturate the network . Uh , so , um , you know , you should {disfmarker} you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , uh , just because then it would keep other people {disfmarker} Grad G : Oh , too much file transfer and stuff . PhD F : Well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with {disfmarker} if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . Um , Grad G : OK . PhD F : so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time . Um . So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , um , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use "" run command "" , uh , to only have ten of those going at a time .

Marketing : Yeah but this this turning {disfmarker} can you can you just re explain me the {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : As a principle . {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : {vocalsound} Please . User Interface : Th this is the base . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : So you can turn to change the channel . Marketing : Yeah . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? User Interface : You just tu turn d d Industrial Designer : I think maybe if you he Project Manager : Oh , ok I understand . Marketing : Like if you want to go from {disfmarker} User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : You take take {vocalsound} the remote , so {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : If you hear some click {disfmarker} Project Manager : and you can turn like that to change the channel ? {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : Yeah but imagine you y Project Manager : I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast . {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to {disfmarker} if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? {vocalsound} User Interface : No , no , no . I {disfmarker} if y uh if {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : it depend on the the angle you turn the {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . I agree . I agree . Industrial Designer : Yeah but y how {disfmarker} you need to know {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Marketing : But I mean if you're fro from two ? User Interface : I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . Industrial Designer : I think something that {disfmarker} Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , you have a {vocalsound} , like that , and so on . User Interface : So change . Yeah . Industrial Designer : And you you can {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : Oh yeah . User Interface : Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the {disfmarker} by three hundred thirteen degree . Marketing : We're not talking {disfmarker} Yeah . User Interface : So you got how many degree you you {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : I think you can if you have a scale , so {disfmarker} User Interface : No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : then the angle you stop is the angle you {disfmarker} is the channel you {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? User Interface : It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the {disfmarker} Marketing : So you you count {gap} one degree , two degrees , no . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it . Marketing : I don't think so . {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah , it's a bit difficult . User Interface : I think so {vocalsound} I think so you can do it . {vocalsound} I think so , you can just change . Industrial Designer : I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main {disfmarker} User Interface : There's uh also a number , you know . Project Manager : Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's {disfmarker} you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . Industrial Designer : Uh , yeah , and y that's {disfmarker} yeah . Project Manager : But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it .

Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} To compensate {gap} . Marketing : Solar . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : So Marketing : So , which number ? Project Manager : {disfmarker} three . Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Do you agree ? User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Three ? User Interface : Yeah , agree , agree . Marketing : So reasonably , is four , is one ? Industrial Designer : Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . Marketing : So , three . User Interface : {gap} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and {disfmarker} no and just take the mean . User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : And what's your opinion ? Industrial Designer : Will you give four ? Marketing : Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . Industrial Designer : Five ? Yeah , so maybe if {disfmarker} User Interface : Uh w w what do y what uh {disfmarker} you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have {disfmarker} you just turn the turn the ball . Industrial Designer : Yeah but y you know {gap} {disfmarker} User Interface : There's two kind of balls , Marketing : So you have {disfmarker} User Interface : the smaller the the the {disfmarker} so you can c you can c you can control the scale . Marketing : {vocalsound} yeah . User Interface : But in the traditional controller , how do {disfmarker} how can you control the scale ? Marketing : Uh by pushing zero after after the first one . Industrial Designer : You just push two button , zero and and one . User Interface : Yeah , Industrial Designer : And that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here .

Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Previously you said that turning this was the fine {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah , if you're changing your mind . Industrial Designer : {gap} Marketing : Fine to coarse . Project Manager : Fine to coarse . User Interface : Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : And from ten to ten channels here . User Interface : Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this . Project Manager : Okay .

Industrial Designer : I'll put four . Project Manager : Gonna say four . Marketing : Four . Industrial Designer : Yeah , four it's more reasonable . Marketing : Uh it's even easier to {disfmarker} maybe . Industrial Designer : You can you can erase with this er yeah . Marketing : Ok User Interface : Okay . Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so . So it's nine , Marketing : So , average ? Industrial Designer : nine over three . User Interface : Three ? Marketing : Three ?

Do not provide anything else other than generated questions separaterd by commas. Document: Marketing : {vocalsound} L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use? Industrial Designer : Eh, for th the vocal command yes, it's might be easy. But it's just speaking. User Interface : Yeah, it's very easy. Industrial Designer : You just need the command. User Interface : You can use this in this way. Marketing : Yeah but this this turning {disfmarker} can you can you just re explain me the {disfmarker} Project Manager : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : As a principle. {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : {vocalsound} Please. User Interface : Th this is the base. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} User Interface : So you can turn to change the channel. Marketing : Yeah. Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels? User Interface : You just tu turn d d Industrial Designer : I think maybe if you he Project Manager : Oh, ok I understand. Marketing : Like if you want to go from {disfmarker} User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : You take take {vocalsound} the remote, so {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : If you hear some click {disfmarker} Project Manager : and you can turn like that to change the channel? {vocalsound} User Interface : Yeah. Yeah. Marketing : Yeah but imagine you y Project Manager : I think it's quite easy to so s zapping, but maybe it will be too fast. {vocalsound} User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to {disfmarker} if you wanna jump from, I dunno, one to twenty? Industrial Designer : Oh yeah, that's difficult. That's dif that's difficult. User Interface : Yeah. Marketing : How can you go directly to twenty, for example? {vocalsound} User Interface : No, no, no. I {disfmarker} if y uh if {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah. User Interface : it depend on the the angle you turn the {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah. I agree. I agree. Industrial Designer : Yeah but y how {disfmarker} you need to know {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Marketing : But I mean if you're fro from two? User Interface : I if if this is a channel one. So it c it could be channel two, channel three, channel four, channel five. Industrial Designer : I think something that {disfmarker} Yeah. Project Manager : Yeah, you have a {vocalsound}, like that, and so on. User Interface : So change. Yeah. Industrial Designer : And you you can {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh {disfmarker} Project Manager : Oh yeah. User Interface : Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the {disfmarker} by three hundred thirteen degree. Marketing : We're not talking {disfmarker} Yeah. User Interface : So you got how many degree you you {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} Project Manager : Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : I think you can if you have a scale, so {disfmarker} User Interface : No no, you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop, the the turn, Project Manager : Mm-hmm. User Interface : then the angle you stop is the angle you {disfmarker} is the channel you {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah. How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one? User Interface : It's it's very easy, because you kn you know how many channel are there in the {disfmarker} Marketing : So you you count {gap} one degree, two degrees, no. User Interface : Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do it. Marketing : I don't think so. {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah, it's a bit difficult. User Interface : I think so {vocalsound} I think so you can do it. {vocalsound} I think so, you can just change. Industrial Designer : I think b but the the vocal command is easy too. You can say fifty and fifty it's okay, so {disfmarker} Marketing : Yeah voc vocal command is okay. But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main {disfmarker} User Interface : There's uh also a number, you know. Project Manager : Yeah, but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other, so you're passing through all the channels. So, when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's {disfmarker} you've decided to go to channel twenty, so you can say channel twenty, or channel four, because you really want to go on this channel. Industrial Designer : Uh, yeah, and y that's {disfmarker} yeah. Project Manager : But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do, you can turn it. Marketing : And this would be more for browsing, ah. User Interface : {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah. Project Manager : Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting? Industrial Designer : Yeah. To see uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer : yeah {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah. Yeah. Industrial Designer : Yeah. Marketing : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : Seems to be good. User Interface : Yeah.

You {gap}. Industrial Designer : And but I'd {disfmarker} User Interface : And also you can, if you i Project Manager : {gap} yeah, what's what's this cherry? User Interface : You ca you can turn this. Or you ca you can you can also turn this. Industrial Designer : It is a turn off t turn off button, maybe. User Interface : For this you can tune it's for tune. You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two, you you skip this. If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound} User Interface : It's like fine, from coarse to fine. Marketing : Mm. User Interface : This is coarse, this is fine. Industrial Designer : Yeah, yeah yeah. That's Project Manager : Okay. User Interface : So it's coarse to fine design. Industrial Designer : that's very technologic, so. {vocalsound} Yeah. User Interface : Yeah. {vocalsound} Marketing : Okay the uh th this looks better. Yeah. User Interface : Yeah is is {disfmarker} this is, from one channel to maybe to ten channel. Industrial Designer : S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates User Interface : This is from one channel to {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : maybe one of the {disfmarker} User Interface : Yeah. Yeah. Project Manager : Yeah, th you have the vocal commands. Industrial Designer : Uh it's k {gap} User Interface : Yeah. Project Manager : On off. Industrial Designer : on off, yeah. Project Manager : {vocalsound} Marketing : Yeah, but it has to be on to recognise fas Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Project Manager : Most of the time you have the {disfmarker} yeah it's a sleeping remote control. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah, sleeping. Marketing : Ah, that's not the ecological part, yeah. Project Manager : That's true. W that why we have the solar ti yeah. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} To compensate {gap}. Marketing : Solar. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Yeah. User Interface : Okay. Project Manager : So Marketing : So, which number? Project Manager : {disfmarker} three. Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Easy to use, it's very relative but three it's fine, I think, it's reasonable three. {vocalsound} Project Manager : Do you agree? User Interface : Mm-hmm. Project Manager : Three? User Interface : Yeah, agree, agree. Marketing : So reasonably, is four, is one? Industrial Designer : Three f three for me, it's o it's okay. Marketing : So, three. User Interface : {gap} Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Four or three. Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and {disfmarker} no and just take the mean. User Interface : {vocalsound} Project Manager : And what's your opinion? Industrial Designer : Will you give four? Marketing : Uh we wouldn't say, I mean, those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me. Industrial Designer : Five? Yeah, so maybe if {disfmarker} User Interface : Uh w w what do y what uh {disfmarker} you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller? Marketing : Yeah. User Interface : I think it's easier than traditional controller. If you use traditional controller you have to put a button, but now you don't have to put button, you have {disfmarker} you just turn the turn the ball. Industrial Designer : Yeah but y you know {gap} {disfmarker} User Interface : There's two kind of balls, Marketing : So you have {disfmarker} User Interface : the smaller the the the {disfmarker} so you can c you can c you can control the scale. Marketing : {vocalsound} yeah. User Interface : But in the traditional controller, how do {disfmarker} how can you control the scale? Marketing : Uh by pushing zero after after the first one. Industrial Designer : You just push two button, zero and and one. User Interface : Yeah, Industrial Designer : And that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} User Interface : yeah, yeah, y you you can do it, but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here.

1136,"Industrial Designer : Yep . So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ Marketing : Ah . Industrial Designer : and then uh titanium , which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some {gap} , moving {gap} kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . Project Manager : Mm-hmm , okay . Industrial Designer : So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . Marketing : What is a double-curved shape ? Industrial Designer : {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves . Marketing : Uh-huh . User Interface : Why ? Industrial Designer : Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition Marketing : {vocalsound} Industrial Designer : we want to reduce uh cost . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . Marketing : The cost . Industrial Designer : Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things Project Manager : Okay . You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : and {disfmarker} Yeah . User Interface : W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Mm like this ? Project Manager : Yes so mm {disfmarker} User Interface : to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Like in cell phones recently Project Manager : Uh-huh . User Interface : {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker} Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Okay . {gap} Industrial Designer : yeah . But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap} Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : rubber is expensive Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : And this push buttons Project Manager : Uh yeah so Industrial Designer : {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money Project Manager : Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated . Industrial Designer : for {disfmarker} S S Marketing : Speech {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Okay , and still we have {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : so {disfmarker} User Interface : mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? Marketing : L_C_D_ . User Interface : L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : Uh l Marketing : Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button . Industrial Designer : So uh User Interface : No , Industrial Designer : it's like a {disfmarker} User Interface : it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus . Marketing : Ah . Industrial Designer : Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and {disfmarker} User Interface : Okay , so let's try it , let's t Industrial Designer : because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or {gap} or something so we want to reduce the cost on display Marketing : {gap} The L_C_D_ would {disfmarker} Industrial Designer : or this inter Marketing : The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information . Marketing : Just uh for output , yeah . Industrial Designer : Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : because like it won't take much money I guess , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : because {disfmarker} Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Okay , yep . Project Manager : {gap} Mm . Industrial Designer : You have any further questions or ? Marketing : I guess no um . So the batteries uh are going to be very light . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries Marketing : Okay . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : for really light batteries and with uh good price . Marketing : So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be {disfmarker} ask . Industrial Designer : Yeah , that's {disfmarker} then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it {disfmarker} m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology Project Manager : Okay , Industrial Designer : and so {disfmarker} Project Manager : for the location . Hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , if if everybody in the house n {gap} to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something . Marketing : Okay . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Okay . So let's now go to the {disfmarker} you don't have more question ? Industrial Designer : {gap} Marketing : No , it's okay . Project Manager : Um mm thank you mm . User Interface : No more questions . Industrial Designer : Yep . Thank you . Marketing : Puts less of constraint on what we can do Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Mm yeah , yeah . Marketing : but Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : it's always like that . We have dreams and the {disfmarker} in the end we find out that it's not feasible . {vocalsound} Project Manager : Yeah , but {disfmarker} mm . Industrial Designer : Oh . We have uh some limitations {gap} . {vocalsound} Marketing : Anyway . {vocalsound} Yeah . User Interface : But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice , Marketing : L_C_D_ .

Industrial Designer : Yeah, that's {disfmarker} then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it {disfmarker} m maybe at least five, six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition Marketing : Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer : whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent.

Hmm. Industrial Designer : Yeah, if if everybody in the house n {gap} to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something.

Summary of experiments since , well , since last week Professor D : Oh . OK . PhD A : and also since the {disfmarker} we 've started to run {disfmarker} work on this . Um . {pause} So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um {vocalsound} uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely {disfmarker} Professor D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .  PhD A : well , it 's still not completely filled , Professor D :  PhD A : but {pause} we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and {pause} finally , hhh , {comment} um {pause} ehhh {comment} PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh {pause} I don't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next {disfmarker} t the second , uh , part of the table , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : uh {pause} when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta . Professor D : a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance , PhD A : Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So {disfmarker} Professor D : but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ? PhD A : Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much {pause} uh uh much smaller Professor D : Yes . PhD A : um {disfmarker} Grad C : It 's out of the way .

PhD A : um {pause} when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : and training with other languages is a little bit worse . Professor D : Um {disfmarker} Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet . PhD A : So , Professor D : Uh , {comment} {pause} yes . PhD A : yeah . Professor D : OK . PhD A : And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's {disfmarker} we have one hundred and seventy - two , Professor D : Yes . PhD A : and one hundred and four when we use delta . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : Uh . {pause} Even if the contexts used is quite the same , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : because without delta we use seventeenths {disfmarker} seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : And , fff {comment} um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from {comment} uh English digits , and from Italian digits .

But Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well . Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps {disfmarker} well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal . The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs . And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs . Um , yeah . Mmm . You know you can {disfmarker} you can comment these results , PhD B : Yes , I can s I would like to say that , for example , um , mmm , if we doesn't use the delta - delta , uh we have an improve when we use s some combination . But when PhD A : Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy . PhD B : w Yeah , this {disfmarker} Yeah , this number recognition acc PhD A : So it 's not the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Again we switch to another {disfmarker} PhD B : Yes , and the baseline {disfmarker} the baseline have {disfmarker} i is eighty - two . Professor D : Baseline is eighty - two . PhD B : Yeah PhD A : So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this . Professor D : Uh , this is Italian mismatched . PhD A : Um . PhD B : Yeah , by the moment . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : OK . PhD B : And first in the experiment - one I {disfmarker} I do {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I use different MLP , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better . Um . for the ne {disfmarker} rest of experiment I use multi - English , only multi - English . And I try to combine different type of feature , but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy . PhD A : Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , the huge table , um , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : but this is not the case for Italian what {disfmarker} where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : So , um {vocalsound} uh , well , I don't think this is a bug but this {disfmarker} this is something in {disfmarker} probably in the MSG um process that uh I don't know what exactly . Perhaps the fact that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} there 's no low - pass filter , well , or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian , or , well , something simple like that . But {disfmarker} that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP . Professor D : I Um , the uh , baseline system {disfmarker} when you said the baseline system was uh , uh eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? That was , uh Italian mismatched d uh , uh , digits , uh , is the testing , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : and the training is Italian digits ? PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : So the "" mismatch "" just refers to the noise and {disfmarker} and , uh microphone and so forth , PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : right ? So , um did we have {disfmarker} So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is {disfmarker} is the uh Italian digits ? PhD B : The train the training of the HTK ? Professor D : The {disfmarker} PhD B : Yes . Ah yes ! Professor D : Yes . PhD B : This h Yes . Th - Yes . Professor D : Yes . Training of the net , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : yeah . So , um {disfmarker} So what that says is that in a matched condition , {vocalsound} we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP . Now w would {disfmarker} do we have a number , I suppose for the matched {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't mean matched , but uh use of Italian {disfmarker} training in Italian digits for PLP only ? PhD B : Uh {pause} yes ? PhD A : Uh {pause} yeah , so this is {disfmarker} basically this is in the table . Uh {pause} so the number is fifty - two , PhD B : Another table . PhD A : uh {disfmarker} Professor D : Fifty - two percent . PhD A : Fift - So {disfmarker} No , it 's {disfmarker} it 's the {disfmarker} PhD B : No . Professor D : No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ? PhD A : Of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of uh {pause} eighteen {disfmarker} PhD B : Eighty . PhD A : of eighteen . PhD B : Eighty . PhD A : So it 's {disfmarker} it 's error rate , basically . PhD B : It 's plus six . PhD A : It 's er error rate ratio . So {disfmarker}  Professor D : Oh this is accuracy !  PhD A : Uh , so we have nine {disfmarker} nine {disfmarker} let 's say ninety percent . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Oy ! {comment} OK . Ninety . PhD A : Yeah . Um {comment} which is uh {comment} what we have also if use PLP and MSG together , Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : eighty - nine point seven . Professor D : OK , so even just PLP , uh , it is not , in the matched condition {disfmarker} Um I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping . PhD A : Uh . P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same {disfmarker} same results . Professor D : Same result pretty much ? PhD A : Well , we have these results . I don't know . It 's not {disfmarker} Do you have this result with PLP alone , {comment} j fee feeding HTK ? Professor D : So , s PhD A : That {disfmarker} That 's what you mean ? PhD B : Yeah , PhD A : Just PLP at the input of HTK . PhD B : yeah yeah yeah yeah , at the first {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . So , PLP {disfmarker} Professor D : Eighty - eight point six . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Um , so adding MSG PhD A : Um {disfmarker} Professor D : um {disfmarker} Well , but that 's {disfmarker} yeah , that 's without the neural net , PhD A : Yeah , that 's without the neural net Professor D : right ? PhD A : and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization . Professor D : But she had said eighty - two . PhD A : This is the {disfmarker} w well , but this is without on - line normalization . Professor D : Right ? Oh , this {disfmarker} the eighty - two . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B :  PhD A : Eighty - two is the {disfmarker} it 's the Aurora baseline , so MFCC . Then we can use {disfmarker} well , OGI , they use MFCC {disfmarker} th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization Professor D : Oh , I 'm sorry , I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy . PhD A : Yeah , sorry . Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . Alright . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Alright . So this is {disfmarker} I was thinking all this was worse . OK so this is all better PhD B : Yes , better . Professor D : because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm all better now . OK , go ahead . PhD A : So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent . Professor D : Yeah . Mm - hmm . PhD A : Uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same . We j jump to ninety percent . PhD B : Nnn , we don't know exactly . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : And {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} whatever the normalization , actually . If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . So {disfmarker} Professor D : So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to {disfmarker} to ninety , or something . PhD A : Well , ninety {disfmarker} No , I {disfmarker} I mean ninety It 's around eighty - nine , ninety , eighty - eight . Professor D : Eighty - nine . PhD A : Well , there are minor {disfmarker} minor differences . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : And then adding the MSG does nothing , basically . PhD A : No . Professor D : Yeah . OK . PhD A : Uh For Italian , yeah . Professor D : For this case , right ? PhD A : Um . Professor D : Alright . So , um {disfmarker} So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you {disfmarker} uh does not help in that case . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Um {disfmarker} PhD A :  But w Yeah . Professor D : The other ones , we 'd have to look at it , but {disfmarker} And the multi - English , does uh {disfmarker} So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with , uh eighteen percent error rate , roughly . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Um {pause} and {pause} we uh almost , uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net . PhD A : Yeah Professor D : And the MSG doesn't however particularly affect things . PhD A : No . Professor D : And we cut off , I guess about twenty - five percent of the error . Uh {pause} no , not quite that , is it . Uh , two point six out of eighteen . About , um {pause} sixteen percent or something of the error , um , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor D : Not matching condition , but uh , the uh , Italian training . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . PhD A : Mmm . PhD B : We select these {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these tasks because it 's the more difficult . Professor D : Yes , good . OK ? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gonna have matching , uh , data for the {disfmarker} uh for the new {disfmarker} for the other languages and so forth . Um , one qu thing is that , uh {disfmarker} I think I asked you this before , but I wanna double check . When you say "" ME "" in these other tests , that 's the multi - English , PhD A : That 's {disfmarker} it 's a part {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} Professor D : but it is not all of the multi - English , right ? It is some piece of {disfmarker} part of it . PhD A : Or , one million frames . Professor D : And the multi - English is how much ? PhD B : You have here the information . PhD A : It 's one million and a half . Yeah . Professor D : Oh , so you used almost all You used two thirds of it , PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : you think . So , it it 's still {disfmarker} it hurts you {disfmarker} seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish . PhD A : Mmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : I wonder why Yeah . Uh . Grad C : Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled , PhD A : Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} PhD B : Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . Grad C : the French and the Spanish . PhD B : The Spanish . Maybe for that . Professor D : Hmm . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : It 's still {disfmarker} OK . Alright , go ahead . And then {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} PhD B : Um . Mmm , with the experiment type - two , I {disfmarker} first I tried to to combine , nnn , some feature from the MLP and other feature {disfmarker} another feature . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : And we s we can {disfmarker} first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , and we can see that in the situation , uh , the MSG - three , the same help nothing . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : And then I do the same but with the delta and delta - delta {disfmarker} PLP delta and delta - delta . And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . And we have a l little bit less result than the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Maybe if {disfmarker} when we have the new {disfmarker} the new {pause} neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe the final result must be better . I don't know . PhD A : Actually , just to be some more {disfmarker} PhD B : Uh {disfmarker} PhD A : Do This number , this eighty - seven point one number , has to be compared with the Professor D : Yes , yeah , I mean it can't be compared with the other PhD A : Which number ? Professor D : cuz this is , uh {disfmarker} with multi - English , uh , training . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box , which is that , uh the eighty - four point six . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Right ? PhD A : Uh . Professor D : So {disfmarker} PhD A : Yeah , but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : and straight features with delta - delta . And straight features with delta - delta gives you what 's on the first sheet . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Yeah . Not t not PhD A : It 's eight eighty - eight point six . Professor D : tr No . No . No . PhD B : Yes . Professor D : Not trained with multi - English . PhD A : Uh , yeah , but th this is the second configuration . PhD B : No , but they {disfmarker} they feature @ @ without {disfmarker} PhD A : So we use feature out uh , net outputs together with features . So yeah , this is not {disfmarker} perhaps not clear here but in this table , the first column is for MLP and the second for the features . Professor D : Eh . {comment} Oh , I see . Ah . So you 're saying w so asking the question , "" What {disfmarker} what has adding the MLP done to improve over the , PhD A : So , just {disfmarker} Yeah so , actually it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it decreased the {disfmarker} the accuracy . Professor D : uh {disfmarker} PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Yes . PhD A : Because we have eighty - eight point six . Professor D : Uh - huh . PhD A : And even the MLP alone {disfmarker} What gives the MLP alone ? Multi - English PLP . Oh no , it gives eighty - three point six . So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six , PhD B : But {disfmarker} PhD A : that gives eighty - seven point one . Professor D : Mm - hmm . Eighty - s I thought it was eighty Oh , OK , eighty - three point six and eighty {disfmarker} eighty - eight point six . PhD A : Eighty - three point six . Eighty {disfmarker} Professor D : OK . PhD A : Is th is that right ? Yeah ? PhD B : Yeah . But {disfmarker} I don't know {disfmarker} but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP {pause} delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help . PhD A : Perhaps , yeah . Professor D : Well , that 's {disfmarker} that 's one thing , but see the other thing is that , um , I mean it 's good to take the difficult case , but let 's {disfmarker} let 's consider what that means . What {disfmarker} what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that {disfmarker} I mean my interpretation of your {disfmarker} your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation . When we train on data that is in one sense or another , similar to the testing data , then we get a win by having discriminant training . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : When we train on something that 's quite different , we have a potential to have some problems . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : And , um , if we get something that helps us when it 's somewhat similar , and doesn't hurt us too much when it {disfmarker} when it 's quite different , that 's maybe not so bad . PhD A : Yeah . Mmm . Professor D : So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on , uh {disfmarker} on say digits , PhD A : On TI - digits ? OK . Professor D : you know , d Was that experiment done ? PhD A : No , not yet . Professor D : Yeah , OK . Uh , then does that , eh {disfmarker} you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , {comment} does it {disfmarker} does it then look much better ? PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh {disfmarker} of tests ? So , an anyway . OK , go ahead . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , uh , d I have found more or less the same result . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : So , it 's slightly better , PhD B : Little bit better ? PhD A : yeah . Professor D : Slightly better . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Slightly bet better . Yes , is better . Professor D : And {disfmarker} and you know again maybe if you use the , uh , delta {pause} there , uh , you would bring it up to where it was , uh you know at least about the same for a difficult case . PhD B : Yeah , maybe . Maybe . Maybe . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Oh , yeah . PhD A : Yeah . Well , so perhaps let 's {disfmarker} let 's jump at the last experiment . PhD B :  Oh , yeah . Professor D : So . PhD A : It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output . PhD B : i Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : It 's again better . So it 's eighty - nine point {disfmarker} point one . PhD B : Yeah , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and we have only forty {disfmarker} forty feature PhD A : So . PhD B : because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature . Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . And then w with the first configuration , I f I am found that work , uh , doesn't work {disfmarker} Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : uh , well , work , but is better , the second configuration . Because I {disfmarker} for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta , here I have eighty - five point three accuracy , and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one .","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions.

I mean, we're testing noise robustness but let's not get silly. OK, so, uh, you've got some, uh, Xerox things to pass out? PhD A : Yeah, Professor D : That are {disfmarker} PhD A : um. Professor D : Yeah. PhD A : Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry for the table, but as it grows in size, uh, it. Professor D : Uh, so for th the last column we use our imagination. OK. PhD B : Ah, yeah. Professor D : Ah. PhD A : Uh, yeah. PhD B : Uh, do you want @ @. Professor D : This one's nice, though. This has nice big font. PhD A : Yeah. Grad C : Let's see. Yeah. Chop! Professor D : Yeah. PhD A : So Professor D : When you get older you have these different perspectives. I mean, lowering the word hour rate is fine, but having big font! PhD A : Next time we will put colors or something. Professor D : That's what's {disfmarker} PhD A : Uh. Professor D : Yeah. It's mostly big font. OK. PhD A : OK, s so there is kind of summary of what has been done {disfmarker} Professor D : Uh {disfmarker} Go ahead. PhD A : It's this. Summary of experiments since, well, since last week Professor D : Oh. OK. PhD A : and also since the {disfmarker} we've started to run {disfmarker} work on this. Um. {pause} So since last week we've started to fill the column with um {vocalsound} uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also, because the column was not completely {disfmarker} Professor D : Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.  PhD A : well, it's still not completely filled, Professor D :  PhD A : but {pause} we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and {pause} finally, hhh, {comment} um {pause} ehhh {comment} PL - uh delta seems very important. Uh {pause} I don't know. If you take um, let's say, anyway Aurora - two - B, so, the next {disfmarker} t the second, uh, part of the table, Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : uh {pause} when we use the large training set using French, Spanish, and English, you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta. Professor D : a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being, uh, the baseline performance, PhD A : Yeah, on the baseline, yeah. So {disfmarker} Professor D : but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK? PhD A : Yeah. Yeah. So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much {pause} uh uh much smaller Professor D : Yes. PhD A : um {disfmarker} Grad C : It's out of the way. PhD A : But, actually, um, for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages. And  Mmm, {pause} Yeah. And f also for Italian, actually. If you take the second set of experiment for Italian, so, the mismatched condition, Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : um {pause} when we use the training on TIMIT so, it's multi - English, we have a ninety - one number, Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : and training with other languages is a little bit worse. Professor D : Um {disfmarker} Oh, I see. Down near the bottom of this sheet. PhD A : So, Professor D : Uh, {comment} {pause} yes. PhD A : yeah. Professor D : OK. PhD A : And, yeah, and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta. If y if I take the training s the large training set, it's {disfmarker} we have one hundred and seventy - two, Professor D : Yes. PhD A : and one hundred and four when we use delta. Professor D : Yeah. PhD A : Uh. {pause} Even if the contexts used is quite the same, Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : because without delta we use seventeenths {disfmarker} seventeen frames. Uh. Yeah, um, so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments, uh, that we did not have last week. Uh, so this is training the net on French only, or on English only, and testing on Italian. Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on, uh TI - digits. Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : And, fff {comment} um, yeah. What we see is that these nets are not as good, except for the multi - English, which is always one of the best. Yeah, then we started to work on a large dat database containing, uh, sentences from the French, from the Spanish, from the TIMIT, from SPINE, uh from {comment} uh English digits, and from Italian digits. So this is the {disfmarker} another line {disfmarker} another set of lines in the table. Uh, @ @ with SPINE Professor D : Ah, yes. Mm - hmm. PhD A : and {pause} uh, actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data, uh, so we have to to redo the uh {disfmarker} the experiment training the net with, uh PLP, but with delta. But Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : um this {disfmarker} this net performed quite well. Well, it's {disfmarker} it's better than the net using French, Spanish, and English only. Uh. So, uh, yeah. We have also started feature combination experiments. Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together. And this is {disfmarker} The results are on the other document. Uh, we can discuss this after, perhaps {disfmarker} well, just, @ @. Yeah, so basically there are four {disfmarker} four kind of systems. The first one, yeah, is combining, um, two feature streams, uh using {disfmarker} and each feature stream has its own MPL. So it's the {disfmarker} kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first. The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal. The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs. And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs. Um, yeah. Mmm. You know you can {disfmarker} you can comment these results, PhD B : Yes, I can s I would like to say that, for example, um, mmm, if we doesn't use the delta - delta, uh we have an improve when we use s some combination. But when PhD A : Yeah, we ju just to be clear, the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy. PhD B : w Yeah, this {disfmarker} Yeah, this number recognition acc PhD A : So it's not the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Again we switch to another {disfmarker} PhD B : Yes, and the baseline {disfmarker} the baseline have {disfmarker} i is eighty - two. Professor D : Baseline is eighty - two. PhD B : Yeah PhD A : So it's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this. Professor D : Uh, this is Italian mismatched. PhD A : Um. PhD B : Yeah, by the moment. PhD A : Mm - hmm. Professor D : OK. PhD B : And first in the experiment - one I {disfmarker} I do {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I use different MLP, Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD B : and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better. Um. for the ne {disfmarker} rest of experiment I use multi - English, only multi - English. And I try to combine different type of feature, but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy. PhD A : Yeah, eh, actually, if w we look at the table, the huge table, um, we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP, Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : but this is not the case for Italian what {disfmarker} where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP. Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : So, um {vocalsound} uh, well, I don't think this is a bug but this {disfmarker} this is something in {disfmarker} probably in the MSG um process that uh I don't know what exactly. Perhaps the fact that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} there's no low - pass filter, well, or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian, or, well, something simple like that. But {disfmarker} that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information. Professor D : Mm - hmm. PhD A : And as Carmen said, if we combine the two, we have the result, basically, of PLP. Professor D : I Um, the uh, baseline system {disfmarker} when you said the baseline system was uh, uh eighty - two percent, that was trained on what and tested on what? That was, uh Italian mismatched d uh, uh, digits, uh, is the testing, PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : and the training is Italian digits? PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : So the "" mismatch "" just refers to the noise and {disfmarker} and, uh microphone and so forth, PhD A : Yeah. PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : right? So, um did we have {disfmarker} So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is {disfmarker} is the uh Italian digits? PhD B : The train the training of the HTK? Professor D : The {disfmarker} PhD B : Yes. Ah yes! Professor D : Yes. PhD B : This h Yes. Th - Yes. Professor D : Yes. Training of the net, PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : yeah. So, um {disfmarker} So what that says is that in a matched condition, {vocalsound} we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP. Now w would {disfmarker} do we have a number, I suppose for the matched {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't mean matched, but uh use of Italian {disfmarker} training in Italian digits for PLP only? PhD B : Uh {pause} yes? PhD A : Uh {pause} yeah, so this is {disfmarker} basically this is in the table. Uh {pause} so the number is fifty - two, PhD B : Another table. PhD A : uh {disfmarker} Professor D : Fifty - two percent. PhD A : Fift - So {disfmarker} No, it's {disfmarker} it's the {disfmarker} PhD B : No. Professor D : No, fifty - two percent of eighty - two? PhD A : Of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of uh {pause} eighteen {disfmarker} PhD B : Eighty. PhD A : of eighteen. PhD B : Eighty. PhD A : So it's {disfmarker} it's error rate, basically. PhD B : It's plus six. PhD A : It's er error rate ratio. So {disfmarker}  Professor D : Oh this is accuracy!  PhD A : Uh, so we have nine {disfmarker} nine {disfmarker} let's say ninety percent. PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : Oy! {comment} OK. Ninety. PhD A : Yeah. Um {comment} which is uh {comment} what we have also if use PLP and MSG together, Professor D : Yeah. PhD A : eighty - nine point seven. Professor D : OK, so even just PLP, uh, it is not, in the matched condition {disfmarker} Um I wonder if it's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra, or whether it's that the net half, for some reason, is not helping.

It's not {disfmarker} Do you have this result with PLP alone, {comment} j fee feeding HTK? Professor D : So, s PhD A : That {disfmarker} That's what you mean? PhD B : Yeah, PhD A : Just PLP at the input of HTK. PhD B : yeah yeah yeah yeah, at the first {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} Yeah. PhD A : Yeah. So, PLP {disfmarker} Professor D : Eighty - eight point six. PhD A : Yeah. Professor D : Um, so adding MSG PhD A : Um {disfmarker} Professor D : um {disfmarker} Well, but that's {disfmarker} yeah, that's without the neural net, PhD A : Yeah, that's without the neural net Professor D : right? PhD A : and that's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization. Professor D : But she had said eighty - two. PhD A : This is the {disfmarker} w well, but this is without on - line normalization. Professor D : Right? Oh, this {disfmarker} the eighty - two. PhD A : Yeah. PhD B :  PhD A : Eighty - two is the {disfmarker} it's the Aurora baseline, so MFCC. Then we can use {disfmarker} well, OGI, they use MFCC {disfmarker} th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization Professor D : Oh, I'm sorry, I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy. PhD A : Yeah, sorry. Yeah. PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : OK. Alright. PhD A : Yeah. Professor D : Alright. So this is {disfmarker} I was thinking all this was worse. OK so this is all better PhD B : Yes, better. Professor D : because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two. PhD A : Mm - hmm. PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : OK. I'm {disfmarker} I'm all better now. OK, go ahead. PhD A : So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent. Professor D : Yeah. Mm - hmm. PhD A : Uh, when we apply a neural network, is the same. We j jump to ninety percent. PhD B : Nnn, we don't know exactly. Professor D : Yeah. PhD A : And {disfmarker} And um {disfmarker} whatever the normalization, actually. If we use n neural network, even if the features are not correctly normalized, we jump to ninety percent. So {disfmarker} Professor D : So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to {disfmarker} to ninety, or something. PhD A : Well, ninety {disfmarker} No, I {disfmarker} I mean ninety It's around eighty - nine, ninety, eighty - eight. Professor D : Eighty - nine. PhD A : Well, there are minor {disfmarker} minor differences. PhD B : Yeah. Professor D : And then adding the MSG does nothing, basically. PhD A : No. Professor D : Yeah. OK. PhD A : Uh For Italian, yeah. Professor D : For this case, right? PhD A : Um. Professor D : Alright. So, um {disfmarker} So actually, the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG, if you {disfmarker} uh does not help in that case. PhD A : Mm - hmm.

Grad C : Or , three days ? Grad A : Is he {disfmarker} How long is he gone for ? Grad B : Two weeks . Grad A : Italy , huh ? What 's , uh {disfmarker} what 's there ? Grad B : Well , it 's a country . Buildings . People . Grad A : Pasta . Grad C : But it 's not a conference or anything . Grad B : Hmm ? Grad C : He 's just visiting . Grad A : Right . Just visiting . Grad B : Vacation . Grad A : It 's a pretty nice place , in my brief , uh , encounter with it . Grad B : Do you guys {disfmarker} Oh , yeah . So . Part of what we actually want to do is sort of schedule out what we want to surprise him with when {disfmarker} when he comes back . Um , so {disfmarker} Grad C : Oh , I think we should disappoint him . Grad B : Yeah ? You {disfmarker} or have a finished construction parser and a working belief - net , and uh {disfmarker} Grad C : That wouldn't be disappointing . I think w we should do absolutely no work for the two weeks that he 's gone . Grad B : Well , that 's actually what I had planned , personally . I had {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I had sort of scheduled out in my mind that you guys do a lot of work , and I do nothing . And then , I sort of {disfmarker} Grad C : Oh , yeah , that sounds good , too . Grad B : sort of bask in {disfmarker} in your glory . But , uh , i do you guys have any vacation plans , because I myself am going to be , um , gone , but this is actually not really important . Just this weekend we 're going camping . Grad C : Yeah , I 'm wanna be this {disfmarker} gone this weekend , too . Grad B : Ah . But we 're all going to be here on Tuesday again ? Looks like it ? Grad D : Yeah . Grad B : OK , then . Let 's meet {disfmarker} meet again next Tuesday . And , um , finish up this Bayes - net . And once we have finished it , I guess we can , um {disfmarker} and that 's going to be more just you and me , because Bhaskara is doing probabilistic , recursive , structured , object - oriented , uh , Grad C : Killing machines ! Grad B : reasoning machines . Grad A : Yes . Grad B : And , um {disfmarker} Grad C : Killing , reasoning . What 's the difference ? Grad D : Wait . So you 're saying , next Tuesday , is it the whole group meeting , or just us three working on it , or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} ? Grad B : Uh . The whole group . And we present our results , our final , Grad D : OK . Grad B : definite {disfmarker} Grad D : So , when you were saying we {pause} need to do a re - run of , like {disfmarker} Grad A : h What ? Grad D : What {disfmarker} Like , just working out the rest of the {disfmarker} Grad B : Yeah . We should do this th the upcoming days . Grad D : This week ? Grad B : So , this week , yeah . Grad C : When you say , "" the whole group "" , you mean {pause} the four of us , and Keith ? Grad D : OK . Grad B : And , Ami might . Grad C : Ami might be here , and it 's possible that Nancy 'll be here ? Grad B : Yep . Grad C : So , yeah . Grad B : Because , th you know , once we have the belief - net done {disfmarker} Grad C : You 're just gonna have to explain it to me , then , on Tuesday , how it 's all gonna work out . You know . Grad B : We will . OK . Because then , once we have it sort of up and running , then we can start you know , defining the interfaces and then feed stuff into it and get stuff out of it , and then hook it up to some fake construction parser and {disfmarker} Grad C : That you will have in about nine months or so . Grad B : Yeah . Grad C : Yeah . Grad B : And , um , Grad C : The first bad version 'll be done in nine months . Grad B : Yeah , I can worry about the ontology interface and you can {disfmarker} Keith can worry about the discourse . I mean , this is pretty {disfmarker} Um , I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I hope everybody uh knows that these are just going to be uh dummy values , right ? Grad A : Which {disfmarker} Grad B : where the {disfmarker} Grad A : Which ones ? Grad B : S so {disfmarker} so if the endpoint {disfmarker} if the Go - there is Yes and No , then Go - there - discourse will just be fifty - fifty . Right ? Grad A : Um , what do you mean ? If the Go - there says No , then the Go - there is {disfmarker} Grad D : I don't get it . Grad A : I don't u understand . Grad B : Um . Grad A : Like , the Go - there depends on all those four things . Grad B : Yep . Grad A : Yeah . Grad B : But , what are the values of the Go - there - discourse ? Grad A : Well , it depends on the situation . If the discourse is strongly indicating that {disfmarker} Grad B : Yeah , but , uh , we have no discourse input .","systemYou are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant specializing in question generation.user Read the following document and then generate 10 related questions. The questions should be diverse and should ask about different aspects related to the document. No two questions should be asking about the same thing and each question should be a wh-question. Do not provide anything else other than generated questions separaterd by commas. Document: Grad A : Um, I guess, Jerry needs to enter marks, but I don't know if he's gonna do that now or later. But, uh, if he's gonna enter marks, it's gonna take him awhile, I guess, and he won't be here. Grad C : And what's Nancy doing? Grad A : Nancy? Um, she was sorta finishing up the, uh, calculation of marks and assigning of grades, but I don't know if she should be here. Well {disfmarker} or, she should be free after that, so {disfmarker} assuming she's coming to this meeting. I don't know if she knows about it. Grad C : She's on the email list, right? Grad A : Is she? OK. Grad B : Mm - hmm. OK. Because basically, what {disfmarker} where we also have decided, prior to this meeting is that we would have a rerun of the three of us sitting together Grad D : OK. Grad B : sometime {pause} this week {pause} again Grad A : OK. Grad B : and finish up the, uh, values of this. So we have, uh {disfmarker} Believe it or not, we have all the bottom ones here. Grad C : Well, I {disfmarker} Grad D : You added a bunch of {pause} nodes, for {disfmarker}? Grad B : Yep. We {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we have {disfmarker} Actually what we have is this line. Grad D : OK. Grad B : Right? Grad C : Uh, what do the, uh, structures do? Grad B : Hmm? Grad C : So the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} For instance, this Location node's got two inputs, Grad A : Four inputs. Grad B : Hmm. Grad C : that one you {disfmarker} Grad B : Four. Grad A : Those are {disfmarker} The bottom things are inputs, also. Grad C : Oh, I see. Grad A : Yeah. Grad C : OK, that was OK. That makes a lot more sense to me now. Grad B : Yep. Grad C : Cuz I thought it was like, that one in Stuart's book about, you know, the {disfmarker} Grad A : Alarm in the dog? Grad C : U Yeah. Grad A : Yeah. Grad C : Or the earthquake and the alarm. Grad A : Sorry. Yeah, I'm confusing two. Grad C : Yeah, there's a dog one, too, but that's in Java Bayes, Grad A : Right. Grad C : isn't it? Grad A : Maybe. Grad C : But there's something about bowel problems or something with the dog. Grad A : Yeah. Grad B : And we have all the top ones, all the ones to which no arrows are pointing. What we're missing are the {disfmarker} these, where arrows are pointing, where we're combining top ones. So, we have to come up with values for this, and this, this, this, and so forth. And maybe just fiddle around with it a little bit more. And, um. And then it's just, uh, edges, many of edges. And, um, we won't {comment} meet next Monday. So. Grad C : Cuz of Memorial Day? Grad A : We 'll meet next Tuesday, I guess. Grad B : Yep. Yeah. Grad C : When's Jerry leaving for {disfmarker} Italia? Grad B : On {disfmarker} on Friday. Grad A : Which Friday? Grad B : This {disfmarker} this Friday. Grad A : OK. Grad D : Oh. This Friday? Grad C : Ugh. Grad B : This Friday. Grad C : As in, four days? Grad B : Yep. Grad C : Or, three days? Grad A : Is he {disfmarker} How long is he gone for? Grad B : Two weeks. Grad A : Italy, huh? What's, uh {disfmarker} what's there? Grad B : Well, it's a country. Buildings. People. Grad A : Pasta. Grad C : But it's not a conference or anything. Grad B : Hmm? Grad C : He's just visiting. Grad A : Right. Just visiting. Grad B : Vacation.
